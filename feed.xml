I have loved seeing, well hearing the progress and development of the Wrestling With Johners podcast over the last year or so as well as the growth of the community especially on Facebook!
I have previously written reviews and articles over on The Indy Corner as well as providing some content for the podcast too covering a load of British wrestling including Progress and Kamikaze Pro. A few years back I trained for a while with Kamikaze Pro which meant getting trained by Pete Dunne – although my time there was short lived, mostly due to lack of fitness and an injury plus boring stuff like work!
I was fortunate enough to meet Johners through work, it’s always good to make a friend with shared interests and we’ve been able to attend a variety of shows together including Attack!, 4FW and Progress.
I have been a wrestling fan for close to 30 years now – originally through WWF where the first match I saw was a Bret vs Owen bout and was hooked instantly! I started following British Wrestling much later on and have been to many promotions around the country and been fortunate to see so many talents up close who are now on global TV on a weekly basis, and also had some amazing experiences including camel clutches from Sabu and Uhaa Nation/Apollo Crews, commentating on a Juventud Guerera match as well as a multi person elimination match featuring Joe Coffey, Kay Lee Ray, Kenny Williams, Dan Moloney, Pete Dunne, Robbie X and Tyler Bate and of course I can’t leave out  harassing Eddie Dennis with an inflatable sheep for months with a little help from Uhaa Nation and Tomasso Ciampa!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also been fortunate enough to meet some big names over the years including Bret Hart, Scott Hall, Sunny, Ted Dibiase, DDP and even the living legend Virgil who I actually had a really good chat with! Although my personal highlight would be meeting the Hardcore Legend Mick Foley on two occasions and in particularly getting a hug from my hero!
Where do I stand on the WWE/AEW battle? I have said from the start that AEW needs time, they need to do their thing but they will only be successful if they can do it over a long period of time and keep the quality high. WWE is far from perfect, although NXT is arguably the closest thing to it in the whole of wrestling at the moment. I actually think AEW is tracking better than I expected them to be at this stage – some of what they are doing so far is phenomenal especially with some of Jericho’s promo work and what they have achieved so far with their tag division.
I am always keen to find the positives in wrestling, anyone who steps inside the ring is there to entertain and put their bodies on the line to do so – are some better than others? Of course, but I don’t see the point in trying to slate people. Similarly I understand everyone is entitled to their opinion and always happy to listen and discuss different views. That’s part of what makes wrestling fandom amazing

&lt;p&gt;Sarah Shackey interview with Colt Cobana, Colt Cobana, Colt says to be in this tournament is a privilege and an honour. Colt knew Jim and spent a lot of hours talking to him. Colt has been at AAW since the start but he has never had the privilege of representing AAW as champion, he has held the AAW Heritage title but never the AAW Heavyweight title, Colt says he knows Josh wants the Colt Cobana of old and Colt will bring out his serious side and Josh is going to regret ever asking for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jimmy Jacobs comes to the ring dressed in evening clothes and cuts a promo saying he has to take control of the Mance Warner situation. Mance lost a loser leaves AAW match he says thanks to him you will never see Mance Warner again. Then music hits and Good Brother Number 3 comes out who again is obviously Warner in a mask with a kendo stick in his hand. Jimmy picks up a steel chair both swing and miss before Jimmy get’s the advantage GBN3 ducks a chairshot and hits Jimmy round the back of the head with the kendo stick. Jimmy powders outside drags GBN3 outside and they brawl round the outside. Back in the ring security pull both guys apart, the crowd shout “let them fight”.  GBN3 takes his frustrations out on the security&lt;/p&gt;
