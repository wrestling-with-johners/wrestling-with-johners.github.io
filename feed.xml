&lt;p&gt;Johnny Saint and Sid Scala in the ring. Out come Imperium Johnny and Sid present Walter with the new NXT UK title belt. Walter cuts a promo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First match of the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JORDAN DEVLIN Vs. LIGERO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good match. Plenty of back and fourth action. Ligero really needed the win here but it didn’t happen. I believe Devlin has been on a roll on NXT UK for a while. Devlin with the devlin-side for the win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WINNER OF THE MATCH: JORDAN DEVLIN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next match up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ILJA DRAGUNOV Vs. JOSH MORRELL&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was mostly a squash match. I was impressed with Josh here. I have actually met Josh under the name Josh Turbo at a local show in Blackburn. Ok match here. Ilja hitting his finisher for the win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WINNER OF THE MATCH: ILJA DRAGUNOV&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the match Ilja took the microphone and spoke. Joe Coffey came out and spoke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main event now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TRAVIS BANKS Vs. THE BRIAN KENDRICK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great to see Brian Kendrick on NXT UK. This was a good match. They fought to the outside. Kendrick got a good pop from the crowd. I’m not too sure when I last saw Kendrick wrestle last on WWE tv. Good main event and the right person one. Banks with a much needed win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WINNER OF THE MATCH: TRAVIS BANKS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-01-20/wrestlemania 36 logo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;wm36logo&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point in previous years, there would be run-sheets or tentative WrestleMania lineups around, though those have been made more secretive in recent years. According to Sean Ross Sapp from Fightful.com, no one he’s spoken to has seen a run sheet or anything related to WrestleMania 36 yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have even been a couple of people at the WWE Performance Center who have been told to “be ready” in case a WrestleMania spot is there for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-01-20/keith lee.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;keith lee&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could be seen as a massive positive and a welcome change, as compared to previous years. One wrestler spoken to said that it leads them to think WWE will go with who is hot for certain spots, instead of trying to make certain talents hot to fit the roles they’ve already decided for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-01-20/adam cole.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;adam cole&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WrestleMania 36 is more than 2 months away, but there is already speculation regarding potential match-ups and whether NXT talent could be a part of the “Showcase of the Immortals” on April 5th in Tampa, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>john</name></author><summary type="html">It is being reported from sources within WWE that WrestleMania 36 is still “wide open in many regards.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">‘The Man’ and CM Punk on this week’s WWE Backstage</title><link href="/news/Becky-and-CM-Punk-on-WWE-Backstage/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="'The Man' and CM Punk on this week's WWE Backstage" /><published>2020-01-19T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-01-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/news/Becky%20and%20CM%20Punk%20on%20WWE%20Backstage</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/Becky-and-CM-Punk-on-WWE-Backstage/">&lt;p&gt;Current WWE RAW Women’s Champion Becky Lynch has been announced as the guest for Tuesday’s episode of WWE Backstage on FS1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The show will also feature CM Punk’s third appearance as an analyst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combination of Becky Lynch and CM Punk should help to boost viewing figures for WWE Backstage. Which has struggled to maintain a strong viewing audience since the show began in October 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-01-19/CM-Punk-2019.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;cm punk&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with The Royal Rumble PPV just around the corner it will be interesting to hear Punk’s thought’s on the line-up and the build, to one of the most popular WWE Pay-Per-Views of the year.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>john</name></author><summary type="html">Current WWE RAW Women’s Champion Becky Lynch has been announced as the guest for Tuesday’s episode of WWE Backstage on FS1.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">NXT:UK Review - January 16th, 2020</title><link href="/articles/NXT-Review-16th-January-2020/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="NXT:UK Review - January 16th, 2020" /><published>2020-01-17T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-01-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/articles/NXT%20Review%2016th%20January%202020</id><content type="html" xml:base="/articles/NXT-Review-16th-January-2020/">&lt;p&gt;We are coming off the heels off NXT:UK Takeover Blackpool 2. Only 2 matches on this week’s episode on the WWE Network. 
First match is…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-01-17/ballroom.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;empress ballroom&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-kid-vs-joseph-connors&quot;&gt;A-Kid vs. Joseph Connors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-01-17/conners.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;conners&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These matches were taped before takeover Blackpool 2. This was a good match. I do think Connors should have been on the main Takeover card. It’s cool we got a taping before Takeover. A-kid seems to have turned into a jobber. Connors with the win in this match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-01-17/a-kid.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;a-kid&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WINNER OF THE MATCH: Joseph Connors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kassius-ohno-vs-dave-mastiff&quot;&gt;Kassius Ohno vs. Dave Mastiff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-01-17/ohno.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ohno&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another good match here. Hard hitting as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-01-17/mastiff.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;mastiff&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another match I enjoyed but I do think the wrong person won, on this occasion. I thought Ohno was being pushed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-01-17/mastiff2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;mastiff&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WINNER OF THE MATCH: Dave Mastiff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a good episode of NXT:UK.&lt;/p&gt;

We are live and time to make review history. First match is…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;trent-seven-vs-eddie-dennis&quot;&gt;Trent Seven vs. Eddie Dennis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very, very good match to start things out. The crowd are absolutely hot. Hard hitting action. Eddie threw Trent over the top rope for the high spot.  By the way I have a great view of the ring. I did enjoy this match. My prediction came true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winner of the match Eddie Dennis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kay-lee-ray-vs-piper-niven-vs-toni-storm-in-a-triple-threat-match-for-the-nxt-uk-womens-title&quot;&gt;Kay Lee Ray vs Piper Niven vs Toni Storm in a triple threat match for the NXT UK women’s title.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a match. Just incredible! All 3 women left it all in the ring. High spots and high flying action. The crowd were super-hot. I’m lost for words. Toni hit her  finisher and was so close to winning the title but it didn’t happen. So many pin fall attempts, by all 3 women. The title did not change hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-01-17/toni piper ray.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;storm ray niven&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winner of the match and still NXT UK Women’s champion: Kay Lee&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tyler-bate-vs-jordan-devlin&quot;&gt;Tyler Bate vs Jordan Devlin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, wow, wow! What an incredible match. We get an “Are you watching Vince McMahon chant. Another great match. During this match I discovered the commentators are on the balcony above me. I got the prediction wrong for this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-01-17/tylerbate.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;tyler &amp;amp; jordan&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winner of the match: Tyler Bate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet another incredible match. All tag teams in the hunt for the titles. High flying action. Tag Gold on the line. A really hot crowd. This is wrestling! The titles didn’t change hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winner of the match and still NXT UK tag team champions, Gallus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Review time for the main event&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;walter-vs-joe-coffey-for-the-wwe-uk-title&quot;&gt;Walter vs. Joe Coffey for the WWE UK title.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-01-17/referee bump.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;referee&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, just wow! What a match. What a main event. Hard hitting powerful action. I thought this was never going to end. Both men with big moves. The referee got knocked down during the match by Walter, so in comes Alexander Wolfe to help him. Here comes Ilja Dragunov to take out Wolfe, the match continues and didn’t end there. This was breath taking. I’m so happy I got to witness it live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-01-17/imperium.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;walter&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The finish came out of nowhere. A sleeper hold. Yes a sleeper bold from Walter. But wait a minute they are here. It’s the Undisputed Era bay-bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They destroy Imperium. Winner of the match and still WWE UK Champion, Walter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a show and I give it 10 out of 10. I did get to meet the ring announcer, Andy Shepard.&lt;/p&gt;
