&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-02-04/rhea-charlotte.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;charlotte &amp;amp; ripley&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charlotte announced that “She has held the RAW Women’s championship multiple times and has beaten Becky” and that “She’s held the Smackdown Women’s champion multiple times and has beaten Bailey”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-02-04/charlotte.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;charlotte&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the fans in the arena started to chant NXT, Charlotte said that “The Queen has love for NXT and NXT has love for the Queen”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-02-04/rhea.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ripley&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current NXT Women’s champion Ripley came out to address Charlotte. Ripley told Charlotte “That The Queen has already beaten Becky and Bailey. But she has not beaten her”. Ripley continued by saying that she has however beaten the Queen, as Charlotte walked out of the ring, with Ripley holding her NXT gold above her head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-02-04/Charlotte-on-NXT.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;charlotte &amp;amp; ripley&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the evening it was announced that Charlotte will be on NXT this Wednesday on the USA Network, to address Rhea Ripley’s challenge and to announce which title she will be challenging for at WrestleMania 36.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the storyline would suggest it looks certain that the Women’s NXT Championship will be defended at WrestleMania, with Charlotte going up against current NXT Women’s champion Rhea Ripley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-02-04/takeover-portland.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;takeover&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s not forget that Ripley will be defending her NXT Championship on 16th February at NXT Takeover Portland against current No.1 contender Bianca Belair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could also see Charlotte make a cameo apperence during the Ripley vs. Belair match in Portland, further setting up their match for Mania 36.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with Belair’s very strong showing at this year’s Royal Rumble I wouldn’t be surprised to see Belair featured in a WrestleMania match as well. With the possibility of the NXT Women’s championship match becoming a Triple-Threat match between all three.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>john</name></author><summary type="html">On last night’s Monday Night RAW Charlotte Flair conducted an in-ring promo to address which championship she will be challenging for as the Royal Rumble winner, at WrestleMania 36 on 5th April.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">NXT UK Review - 30th January 2020</title><link href="/articles/NXT-Review-30th-January-2020/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="NXT UK Review - 30th January 2020" /><published>2020-02-03T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-02-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/articles/NXT%20Review%2030th%20January%202020</id><content type="html" xml:base="/articles/NXT-Review-30th-January-2020/">&lt;p&gt;NXT UK Review - 30th January 2020&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-hunt-vs-oney-lorcan-and-danny-burch&quot;&gt;THE HUNT Vs. ONEY LORCAN AND DANNY BURCH&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-02-03/primate.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;primate&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good match. I do think Danny should be just NXT UK from now on. This was a fresh match. I do like fresh matches. The Hunt really need that big win, but they didn’t get it here. An assited DDT by Burch and Lorcan for the win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WINNER OF THE MATCH: ONEY LORCAN AND DANNY BURCH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eddie Dennis comes out to cut a promo. Trent Seven interrupts him wanting a rematch and wants it to be a street fight. Eddie and Trent brawl to end this segment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-02-03/eddie-trent.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;eddie trent&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nina-samuels-vs-isla-dawn&quot;&gt;NINA SAMUELS Vs. ISLA DAWN&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok match here, even though it was a rematch. Isla was in control for most of the match. She seems to have got alot better. Isla goes over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-02-03/nina-isla.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;nina and isla&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WINNER OF THE MATCH: ISLA DAWN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tyson-t-bone-vs-ridge-holland&quot;&gt;TYSON T-BONE Vs. RIDGE HOLLAND&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-02-03/ridge.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ridge&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a scrap. A brawl. Hard hitting action. Both men laying in the punches. I liked T-Bone’s attitude here, he needs to show more of it. He also needs a big win, but didn’t get it here. Ridge Holland wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-02-03/ridge2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ridge2&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WINNER OF THE MATCH: RIDGE HOLLAND&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight’s Main Event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;imperium-vs-dave-mastiff-mark-andrews-and-flash-morgan-webster&quot;&gt;IMPERIUM Vs. DAVE MASTIFF, MARK ANDREWS AND FLASH MORGAN WEBSTER&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good match. All men getting some offense in. The crowd was hot for this match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-02-03/6-man.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;6-man&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walter gets involved, taking out Dave Mastiff. I liked this match. Imperium win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-02-03/mastiff-walter.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;mastiff-walter&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WINNER OF THE MATCH: IMPERIUM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good episode of NXT UK. I give it 7 out of 10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnny Saint and Sid Scala in the ring. Out come Imperium Johnny and Sid present Walter with the new NXT UK title belt. Walter cuts a promo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First match of the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JORDAN DEVLIN Vs. LIGERO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good match. Plenty of back and fourth action. Ligero really needed the win here but it didn’t happen. I believe Devlin has been on a roll on NXT UK for a while. Devlin with the devlin-side for the win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WINNER OF THE MATCH: JORDAN DEVLIN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next match up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ILJA DRAGUNOV Vs. JOSH MORRELL&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was mostly a squash match. I was impressed with Josh here. I have actually met Josh under the name Josh Turbo at a local show in Blackburn. Ok match here. Ilja hitting his finisher for the win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WINNER OF THE MATCH: ILJA DRAGUNOV&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the match Ilja took the microphone and spoke. Joe Coffey came out and spoke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main event now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TRAVIS BANKS Vs. THE BRIAN KENDRICK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great to see Brian Kendrick on NXT UK. This was a good match. They fought to the outside. Kendrick got a good pop from the crowd. I’m not too sure when I last saw Kendrick wrestle last on WWE tv. Good main event and the right person one. Banks with a much needed win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WINNER OF THE MATCH: TRAVIS BANKS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-01-20/wrestlemania 36 logo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;wm36logo&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point in previous years, there would be run-sheets or tentative WrestleMania lineups around, though those have been made more secretive in recent years. According to Sean Ross Sapp from Fightful.com, no one he’s spoken to has seen a run sheet or anything related to WrestleMania 36 yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have even been a couple of people at the WWE Performance Center who have been told to “be ready” in case a WrestleMania spot is there for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-01-20/keith lee.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;keith lee&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could be seen as a massive positive and a welcome change, as compared to previous years. One wrestler spoken to said that it leads them to think WWE will go with who is hot for certain spots, instead of trying to make certain talents hot to fit the roles they’ve already decided for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-01-20/adam cole.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;adam cole&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WrestleMania 36 is more than 2 months away, but there is already speculation regarding potential match-ups and whether NXT talent could be a part of the “Showcase of the Immortals” on April 5th in Tampa, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>john</name></author><summary type="html">It is being reported from sources within WWE that WrestleMania 36 is still “wide open in many regards.”</summary></entry></feed>
