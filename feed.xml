&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-01-07/lesnar.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;brock lesnar on raw&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a particularly unusual situation for any WWE or Universal Champion to be a part of the Rumble match itself. As the winner of the Rumble match would usually go on to face either the WWE or Universal Champion at ‘The Showcase of the Immortals’ WrestleMania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This huge announcement became even more unprecedented with Heyman declaring in front of the live crowd on RAW, that Lesnar will not only be in the Royal Rumble match, but Brock will also be the No.1 entrant in the Rumble match. And will have to face and over-come 29 other men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/MRVZe7JBd10&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Lesnar being in the Royal Rumble match, this does not mean that his WWE Championship will be on the line. However, it does mean that if Brock does out last every other man in the match, he will no doubt be able to choose his own opponent at WrestleMania 36, on 5th April 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Royal Rumble takes place on 26th January 2020 from Houston, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>john</name></author><summary type="html">The advocate for current WWE Champion Brock Lesnar, Paul Heyman announced on last night’s RAW (6th Jan 20) that ‘The Beast’ will be a participant in this year’s Royal Rumble match.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Ep91 - NJPW Wrestle Kingdom 14 (Day 1 - 4th Jan 2020) with @KurtsAnglePod</title><link href="/podcasts/EP91/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ep91 - NJPW Wrestle Kingdom 14 (Day 1 - 4th Jan 2020) with @KurtsAnglePod" /><published>2020-01-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-01-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/podcasts/EP91</id><content type="html" xml:base="/podcasts/EP91/"></content><author><name>john</name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Ep92 - NJPW Wrestle Kingdom 14 (Day 2 - 5th Jan 2020) with Griz</title><link href="/podcasts/EP92/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ep92 - NJPW Wrestle Kingdom 14 (Day 2 - 5th Jan 2020) with Griz" /><published>2020-01-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-01-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/podcasts/EP92</id><content type="html" xml:base="/podcasts/EP92/"></content><author><name>john</name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">NXT:UK Review - January 2nd, 2020</title><link href="/articles/NXTUK-Review-January-2nd-2020/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="NXT:UK Review - January 2nd, 2020" /><published>2020-01-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-01-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/articles/NXTUK%20Review%20January%202nd%202020</id><content type="html" xml:base="/articles/NXTUK-Review-January-2nd-2020/">&lt;p&gt;2 additional matches have been made for Takeover Blackpool 2.

&lt;p&gt;First match of 2020 - Dave Mastiff vs Kona Reeves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kona cut a promo before the match to get heat. This was an ok match. Kona hasn’t been too lucky since coming to NXT UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winner of the match: Dave Mastiff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here comes Toni Storm. She calls out Piper Niven she asks Piper to step aside. Piper says no. They brawl and out comes Kay Lee Ray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-01-05/PiperToni.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;piper toni&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kassius Ohno vs Ligero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good match. I enjoyed this one. Kassius is a good heel. He is getting a push on NXT UK more than the normal NXT. Not many High flying moves in this match. Kassius Ohno cuts a promo after the match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winner of the match: Kassius Ohno.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashton Smith and Oliver Carter vs The Outliers: Riddick Moss and Dorian Mack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good tag match. Ashton and Oliver have had no luck and no wins since coming to NXT UK. Hopefully the team of Riddick Moss &amp;amp; Dorian Mack are going to get a push. A very shocking end to the match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winner of the match: Ashton Smith and Oliver Carter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alexander Wolfe vs Ilja Dragunov in a No DQ Match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-01-05/iljawolfe.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ilja wolfe&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good main event. Many weapons involved. Great story telling in this one. The rest of imperium banned from ringside. Ilja went after Alexander before the bell. Brutal match. DDT and a suplex onto chairs. A chair uses on Ilja’s fingers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winner of the match: Ilja Dragunov. Really good way to start off 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

As newly crowned IWGP Intercontinental Champion Tetsuya Naito will face the reigning IWGP Heavyweight Champion, Kaszuskda Okada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-01-04/OkadaNaito.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;okada naito set&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the evening Naito managed to regain the Intercontinental title after defeating Jay White, in a hard fought semi main event, inside of the sold out Tokyo Dome. While Okada battled for over 30+ minutes in an epic main event against Kota Ibushi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Ibushi and Okada withstood a huge amount of offence against one-another, in what was the best match of the night, on a night of excellent matches, in what is already the best show of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Night two of Wrestle Kingdom 14 will not only feature the ‘Double Champ Dash’ between Okada vs. Naito. But will also feature Jon Moxley vs. Juice Robinson  for Moxley’s United States Championship, Chris Jericho vs. Hiroshi Takahashi, Zack Sabre Jr vs. SANADA for the British Heavyweight Championship, Jay White vs. Kota Ibushi,  and of course the final ever match of Jushin ‘Thunder’ Liger’s career.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>john</name></author><summary type="html">After an epic night one of Wrestle Kingdom (4th Jan 2020) the main event of night two (5th Jan 2020) has been cemented.

&lt;p&gt;With the eight teams for the tournament announced, the brackets for this year’s Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic has now been revealed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imperium (Marcel Barthel &amp;amp; Fabian Aichner) vs. The Forgotten Sons (Wesley Blake &amp;amp; Steve Cutler) and Matt Riddle &amp;amp; Pete Dunne vs. Mark Andrews &amp;amp; Flash Morgan Webster are the matches on the left side of the bracket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The right side of the bracket has The Grizzled Young Veterans (Zack Gibson &amp;amp; James Drake) vs. Kushida and his partner (yet to be revealed) and The Undisputed Era (Kyle O’Reilly &amp;amp; Bobby Fish) vs. Gallus (Mark Coffey &amp;amp; Wolfgang).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O’Reilly &amp;amp; Fish are the NXT Tag Team Champions, while Coffey &amp;amp; Wolfgang currently hold the NXT UK Tag Team titles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dusty Classic features four teams from NXT (Undisputed Era, The Forgotten Sons, Riddle &amp;amp; Dunne, and Kushida’s team) and four teams from NXT UK (The Grizzled Young Veterans, Gallus, Imperium, and Andrews &amp;amp; Webster).&lt;/p&gt;

While you would think that the legend might unmask when he retires, that will not be the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an interview with Tokyo Sports Liger said that he will keep his mask even when his time in the ring is done. He said: “If you wear a mask even if you retire, it’s okay to take the name Liger.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liger said that he can’t become a “Sugao”, which means “real face,” or “unmasked face” in his case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jushin Liger made his debut with the mask in 1989.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the first night of WrestleKingdom, he will team with Tatsumi Fujinami, The Great Sasuke &amp;amp; Tiger Mask against Naoki Sano, Shinjiro Otani, Tatsuhito Takaiwa &amp;amp; Ryusuke Taguchi. On night two, he will team with Naoki Sano against Ryu Lee &amp;amp; Hiromu Takahashi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A retirement ceremony will be held at New Year Dash, on 6th January 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

With Becky’s RAW Women’s Championship on the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a backstage segment Becky told Charly Caruso that this was the match she wanted during recent contract negotiations. With Asuka being the only WWE Superstar on the women’s roster that she is yet to defeat. ‘The Man’ is looking for redemption after losing to Asuka at last year’s Royal Rumble, tapping out to the ‘Asuka-lock’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lynch looks to continue her reign as the longest reigning RAW Women’s Champion, which started at WrestleMania 35. But don’t rule out the current Women’s Tag Team Champion Asuka, as she looks to become “Asuka two-belts” on 26th Jan 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
