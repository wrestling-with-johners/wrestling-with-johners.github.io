alt=&quot;North Wrestling&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it‚Äôs birth on to the British wrestling scene back in 2016, North Wrestling has brought to us some of the best this business has to offer, whether that be home grown or international, there‚Äôs something for anyone which is why North has become a firm favourite to fans and wrestlers alike. Having been part of the incredible atmosphere, surrounded by these amazing people it‚Äôs no wonder why this company is a fantastic night out at the Anarchy Brewery Co, Newcastle and always SOLD OUT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let‚Äôs take a look at their fantastic ‚ÄúThe World At Large‚Äù event from 15th October!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;warhorse-vs-jet-marshal&quot;&gt;Warhorse vs Jet Marshal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Straight off the bat we saw the strength of Warhorse as he was able to dictate the match in the early going‚Äôs with Jet fighting back at times. However when his leg was isolated he wasn‚Äôt able to use that quick speed that we are very familiar with the focus moving to the outside when Warhorse performed a ‚ÄòSenton‚Äô through the middle ropes onto Jet and thus into the crowd. The action continued once back in the ring as Jet built up a fantastic comeback with two near falls and kicking out of the ‚ÄòElbow Drop of Death‚Äô but it was too much for him when he finally tapped out of the ‚ÄòScorpion Deathlock of Death‚Äô.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great opening match but unfortunately Warhorse used his strength and aggression to dominate the match and after, he took to the mic to give credit to Jet Marshal for stepping up and offering a fist bump as a mark of respect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We saw footage of ‚ÄúThe Last True Sick Boy‚Äù Rory Coyle getting taken out by Clint Margera which followed with the ULTRA VIOLENCE Champion himself, Rory Coyle coming to the ring to get something off his chest. As he was doing just that we had the pleasure of Zeo Knox &amp;amp; Benji aka The Landed Gentry come to the ring to a resounding boo. After Benji took to the mic to explain why he hates the champ an annoyed Rory stated that he has friends and weapons, inviting the BIGGEST weapon from the back to come out and join them‚Ä¶welcome Conor Renshaw but before he could even get in the ring, Screwface &amp;amp; Big Lou Nixon took them out with the sneak attack which prompted Crash Boat to come to the rescue and even the odds, ultimately resulting in an 8-Man Tag being announced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rory-coyleconor-renshawcrash-boat-vs-the-landed-gentryscrewfacebig-lou-nixon&quot;&gt;Rory Coyle/Conor Renshaw/Crash Boat vs The Landed Gentry/Screwface/Big Lou Nixon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The action spilled out to ringside as soon as the bell rang for the match but it was ‚ÄòStunner‚Äô galore in the early going as Conor hit his opponents one by one with the move to rally up the crowd which then saw each team take turns in dominating the match. As the end of the match drew near Benji used his Croquet mallet to the mid section of Coyle for the upper hand and as he was about to use the commemorative plate of his, ‚ÄúThe Sick Boy‚Äù produced a video tape nasty of his very own, throwing a fireball to the face, resulting in him hitting a ‚ÄòDDT‚Äô for the pin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2022-11-03/image2.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;North Wrestling&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What were you expecting, it was a hard hitting match which descended into chaos with each team having their time to shine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then go to the backstage and see that Screwface &amp;amp; Big Lou Nixon have taken out Crash Boat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lana-austin-w-isaiah-quinn-vs-kasey-owens&quot;&gt;Lana Austin w/ Isaiah Quinn vs Kasey Owens&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just before the match, Quinn decided to have a few words with Lana about her opponent for the night which resulted in Kasey coming to the ring and hitting ‚ÄúThe Queen of Mean‚Äù with a couple of clotheslines but Lana was able to gain momentum with a sidestep resulting in Kasey getting caught up in the ring ropes and then dictating the match until she was hit with a devastating ‚ÄòDeath Valley Driver‚Äô. However after Quinn got involved by grabbing the foot of Kasey that gave Lana the opportunity she needed, hitting her ‚ÄòRoaring Elbow‚Äô and following it up with a ‚ÄòHangman‚Äôs DDT‚Äô for the win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both women are at their peak on the British wrestling scene and it‚Äôs always a pleasure to see these two in the ring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went backstage to see Zeo Knox expressing his displeasure to Benji of loosing early that night and wants another plan for North‚Äôs next show.
It‚Äôs Tag Team action next as Sunshine Machine challenge Boisterous Behaviour for the North Wrestling Tag Team Championship‚Äôs and we are graced by the ‚ÄúLyrical Dragon‚Äù that is Man Like Dereiss &amp;amp; his tag team partner, Leon Slater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sunshine-machine-vs-boisterous-behaviour-c&quot;&gt;Sunshine Machine vs Boisterous Behaviour (c)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team of Mambo &amp;amp; Cooper took control from the off showing why they are one of the best on the wrestling scene with the champions doing whatever they can to sway the match in their favour but to no avail as the challengers continued to dictate. Until a ‚ÄòShooting Star‚Äô was reversed into a ‚ÄòCutter‚Äô followed up with a ‚Äò3D‚Äô. Dereiss then hit a ‚ÄòPowerbomb‚Äô to Mambo which was followed up by a ‚Äò450 Splash‚Äô from Slater but Mambo was able to get his knees upon time, holding Slater in place for Cooper to hit a Stomp. The finish came when both champs were able to hit a ‚Äò450 Splash‚Äô to Sunshine Machine for the win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fantastic match from start to finish as each one of these wrestlers are incredible in the ring and a delight to watch them perform their craft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isaiah Quinn then introduced us to the winner of the Lana/Kasey match which saw Lana thanking everyone but Quinn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kidd-bandit-vs-will-kroos&quot;&gt;Kidd Bandit vs Will Kroos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we saw the debut of ‚ÄúThe Protagonist of Pro Wrestling‚Äù Kidd Bandit taking on ‚ÄúThe Headline‚Äù Will Kroos and before the match even started Bandit was unsure what they‚Äôd got themselves into but a bit of dutch courage came in the form of beer which was downed (in a couple of attempts) and not to be upstaged, Kroos would take up the challenge as well. Bandit tried their best to take control of the match from the beginning using some kicks to the mid section and speed but Kroos used his strength to turn the tide hitting some devastating clotheslines and throwing his opponent from one side of the ring to the other. However the momentum shifted in Bandit‚Äôs favour as they were able to reverse an ‚ÄòOverhead Slam‚Äô into a ‚ÄòDDT‚Äô, followed up with a ‚ÄòSuperkick‚Äô, then a ‚ÄòBoomerang Kick‚Äô, a ‚ÄòMissile Dropkick‚Äô and finally a ‚ÄòV-Trigger‚Äô but only for the two. Even a ‚ÄòSpinal Tap‚Äô wasn‚Äôt enough to keep the North Wrestling regular down. Somehow Bandit was able to kick out of a ‚ÄòSitdown Powerbomb‚Äô but after each pulled out some fantastic reversals the finish came when Kroos hit the ‚ÄòKroosifixion‚Äô onto his opponent for the win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very good match with the ‚ÄúDavid vs Goliath‚Äù layout as both had their time to shine and to be honest, no matter the outcome both were winners and the crowd loved it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hear from Boisterous Behaviour backstage offering a challenge to ANYONE across the globe to step-up to the North Wrestling Tag Team Champions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lizzy-evo-vs-millie-mckenzie&quot;&gt;Lizzy Evo vs Millie McKenzie&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone the North Wrestling faithful love (maybe not) Lizzy returns to take on the debuting Millie McKenzie in what promises to be a belter of a match as both showed why they are just that good in the ring. Both didn‚Äôt see any signs of slowing down as they attacked each other with lightning speed from the start. Evenly matched I didn‚Äôt know which way this one would go as both brought their A game, giving each one time to shine and hitting some beautiful well timed moves which ended when McKenzie hit a ‚ÄòSpear‚Äô to pick up the 3-count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fantastic match for two of the best the British wrestling scene has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see a video looking at the rivalry that has become between former friends, HT Drake and Gene Munny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gene Munny vs HT Drake
It‚Äôs Birthday time for HT Drake as he takes on former friend Gene Munny in what will be a fun filled match. We saw Gene using his ‚ÄúBad Boi‚Äù image to help take advantage of the match in the early goings but HT Drake was able to shift the tide in his favour after reversing a ‚ÄòLow Blow‚Äô attempt with a beautiful ‚ÄòButterfly Suplex‚Äô which also saw him kicking out of a belt shot to the face and Gene‚Äôs ‚ÄòAinsley Lariat‚Äô but when Gene knocked the referee down he thought he had the win in the bag but when he hit the ‚ÄòLow Blow‚Äô it didn‚Äôt work as Drake was wearing a cup which he used to take out (literally) Gene as he used the cup like a ‚ÄòMandible Claw‚Äô to pin the ‚ÄúDirty Dog‚Äù for the win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This match was always going to deliver as both wrestlers know how to work a crowd and it didn‚Äôt disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;its-main-event-time&quot;&gt;It‚Äôs MAIN EVENT time!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;liam-slater-c-vs-joe-hendry&quot;&gt;Liam Slater (c) vs Joe Hendry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2022-11-03/image1.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;North Wrestling&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of the absolute best went one-on-one in the Main Event as Liam Slater defended his North Wrestling Championship against IMPACT WRESTLING‚Äôs newest signing, Joe Hendry and as ever Hendry came with his custom entrance video as it was a play on Lady Gaga‚Äôs ‚ÄúPoker Face‚Äù. The crowd were split down the line for this match as both brought their best, with each man trying to outthink one another. After numerous exchanges, Hendry was able to take control and ground the Champion with a ‚ÄòCobra Clutch‚Äô until Slater reached deep down inside himself to lead but it didn‚Äôt last long as Hendry regained control and momentum until Slater reversed the ‚ÄòHendry Lock‚Äô into a beautiful ‚ÄòSingle Leg Crab‚Äô but Hendry as able to hit a ‚ÄòSuperplex‚Äô followed up with a ‚Äòlariat‚Äô and finally a ‚ÄòPop-Up Powerbomb‚Äô but only for a 2-count. The end came when Slater reversed a ‚ÄòChokeslam‚Äô attempt into a ‚ÄòVictory Roll‚Äô for the win, retaining his North Wrestling Championship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a fantastic, intense match which saw both showing their respect for each other, a true Main Event match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall ‚ÄúThe World At Large‚Äù was a solid show with each match bringing something different to the table and listening to the crowd, they loved it. Good show North!&lt;/p&gt;
