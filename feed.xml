<p>The holidays are over. The time with family and friends is over and now we can all get into full
Royal Rumble mode. It is only a few weeks away and the wrestling world is already buzzing.</p>

<p>One of the reasons for this buzz is the potential surprises for the Rumble match. Every year
there are spots earmarked, in both matches, for some surprise entrants. It is a huge selling point of the
Royal Rumble and one that causes much speculation.</p>

<p>With all the discussion of who could make the match, why not do one ourselves. Let’s look at
some possibilities.</p>

<h2 id="the-rock">The Rock</h2>

<p>The Rock v Roman Reigns has been the WWE’s dream for the past couple years. Having the
cousin’s main event Wrestlemania would be a huge money maker for WWE. It would also make for one
of the biggest matches of all time.</p>

<p>The easiest way to make this happen? Have The Rock return at the Royal Rumble and pace the
field. If he can clear his filming schedule this could be a real possibility.</p>

<h2 id="matt-cardona">Matt Cardona</h2>

<p>The former Zack Ryder has done a great job at reinventing himself post-WWE. Since his release
he has become one of the best wrestlers on the independent scene. His ability to generate heat has
been fantastic and he has become an even bigger name.</p>

<p>Cardona has, recently, expressed interest in a WWE return. Having him come through the
curtain in San Antonio would be a great way to do this.</p>

<h2 id="njpw">NJPW</h2>

<p>With Vince McMahon gone the Forbidden Door has been slightly ajar. Things that we didn’t
think possible before have been starting to come to fruition. Shinsuke Nakamura being permitted to
wrestle for NJPW would not have happened last year.</p>

<p>With Nakamura going back to Japan is begs the question, what deal did Hunter strike to let this
happen? Could it be New Japan letting someone the likes of Jay White or Will Ospreay come through the
door?</p>

<h2 id="pat-mcafee">Pat McAfee</h2>

<p>McAfee has been a great addition to the announce booth in WWE. He has a passion for the
product and knows how to emote that to the audience. He has revitalized the stale broadcast booth and
been involved in some darn entertaining matches.</p>

<p>He has been off programming for a while now, but the rumour mill has started turning. It has
been reported that a return might be imminent for the former Mountaineer. It would be a great surprise
to have him enter the Royal Rumble.</p>

<h2 id="cody-rhodes">Cody Rhodes</h2>

<p>Cody’s return was a huge success for WWE. The prodigal son returned to where he got his start
and engaged in the feud of the year. Himself, and Seth Rollins put on banger after banger for the WWE
Universe.</p>

<p>The momentum was in Cody’s corner, and he seemed to be destined for a World title program
before injury knocked him out of the game.</p>

<p>It has now been months since the injury and the rumours have begun. Cody’s return at the Royal
Rumble would be a great story arc for the son of a son of a plumber.</p>

<h2 id="sasha-banks--naomi">Sasha Banks / Naomi</h2>

<p>One of the biggest stories of the WWE year was Sasha and Naomi walking out. Citing displeasure
with their creative direction, Sasha and Naomi left their tag titles and the company. Ever since that
fateful evening the return of both has been talked about.</p>

<p>Both women have been visible on social media and have achieved great success outside of the
company. With Triple H being in charge could their feelings on WWE change? Both have a good
relationship with the boss and that could be the lynch pin to get them back.</p>

<p>Either returning at the Royal Rumble would be a huge boost to the women’s division and get the
San Antonio fans out of their seats.</p>]]></content><author><name>dan-sinasac</name></author><category term="articles" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Royal Rumble Surprises]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">AEW DYNAMITE POST SHOW PODCAST | JANUARY 4, 2023</title><link href="/jofo-in-the-ring/videos/2023/01/06/AEW-DYNAMITE-POST-SHOW-PODCAST-JANUARY-4-2023/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="AEW DYNAMITE POST SHOW PODCAST | JANUARY 4, 2023" /><published>2023-01-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-01-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/jofo-in-the-ring/videos/2023/01/06/AEW%20DYNAMITE%20POST%20SHOW%20PODCAST%20%20JANUARY%204%202023</id><content type="html" xml:base="/jofo-in-the-ring/videos/2023/01/06/AEW-DYNAMITE-POST-SHOW-PODCAST-JANUARY-4-2023/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name>jofo-in-the-ring</name></author><category term="jofo-in-the-ring" /><category term="videos" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry></feed>
