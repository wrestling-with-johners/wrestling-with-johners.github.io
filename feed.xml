&lt;p&gt;Seriously though…. Oh boy… Where do I start with this one? The original article I had planned, has been promptly pushed out of the way to allow for what you’re about to read. Normally when I write these articles, I strive to be as balanced and as open minded as possible, usually admitting my biases early on to allow you, the reader, to discuss your opinions etc. This time…  I can’t guarantee that it will be. I guess adding that last sentence is my attempt to keep some of that balance in tow and to make you aware that this may not be as well researched as other articles I write. There may be more venom in this article than others. For this I make no apologies. You’ve been warned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-03-04/pulling-hair.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;pulling-hair&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irrespective of your feelings towards the Saudi PPVs, I watched Super Showdown whilst I still can, before the rumoured changes to the WWE Network kick in. That and because, for once, I could watch a PPV at a convenient time and not have to stay up ridiculously late to do so (I’ll discuss this more at a later date); and because it’s Wrestlemania season and feel that I should attempt to at least bring myself up to speed with the events on main roster. Whilst we had some good moments - from Bailey vs. Naomi; the potential Undertaker vs. AJ Styles match at Wrestlemania; to the OC vs The Viking Raiders (granted, this was on the preshow); these were moments that made Super Showdown tolerable. As per the norm with WWE, Super Showdown felt like an extended episode of Raw, with added sprinkles of SmackDown! Albeit, with a depleted roster – whatever their reason for not competing. These are all overshadowed by the way the show ended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-03-04/showdown.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;showdown&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we get to that, there are a few points that I want to raise. We need to discuss the Ricochet/ Lesnar match. Being honest, I don’t remember much from the match itself. I remember Mike Rome (the announcer) potentially mixing Brock and Ricochets’ names – I’m sure he said “Brickochet”; Ricochet bumping like a madman; and the result. That’s it… Ricochet is one of the most talented and beloved wrestlers to ever lace a pair of boots (in my humble opinion) and deserves to be treated with a little more respect. Whilst I am excited to see the predicted Lesnar vs. McIntyre at Wrestlemania, the match between Ricochet and Lesnar could have been booked better. If we look at Tyler Bate vs. Walter from NXTUK Takeover: Cardiff, this is a master class in having a David vs. Goliath match, which put people on the edge of their seats and made them, for that moment, no matter how brief, suspend their belief. Whilst I know Lesnar and Ricochet wouldn’t have lasted as long as Tyler Bate vs. Walter, someone with the talent that Ricochet has could have been made to look strong, but ultimately succumbing to the beast that is Brock Lesnar. This wouldn’t have damaged either party, and would have paved the way for Ricochet to look credible if he were to challenge for the title in the future. Alternatively, McIntyre could have got involved somehow (via video package if he didn’t want to appear in Saudi) to help plant the seeds for Wrestlemania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, we need to discuss the fact that The Undertaker hardly acknowledged the Tuwaiq Trophy after winning it. Without doubt, The Undertaker is one of the greatest of all time. He’s had a career that spans close to 30 years. He’s done everything that can be done in the company. And, it is easy to argue that making a big deal out of the trophy would be out of character for The Undertaker, but doesn’t lack of acknowledgement undermine the trophy itself? Especially as this potentially could have been used as a prop to further the potential feud between AJ and The Undertaker. I appreciate that the creation of this trophy is merely to please the Saudi audience, just like the Greatest Royal Rumble Title, the Tag Team Turmoil World Cup and the WWE World Cup (as a footie fan, both are weird to me). Unless future Saudi PPVs are going to be comprised of matches in which these are defended – which would be amazing as it wouldn’t interfere with the main roster - what is the point in creating something that will never be defended? History tells us that some titles were created to keep individuals happy, such as the European Title being created for the British Bulldog, but even this was defended.  I’m sure others will agree that this is the perfect metaphor for the show itself – something nice and shiny, but it’s something no one particularly wants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-03-04/undertaker.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;undertaker&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this is not why you’ve read so far into this. So, strap yourself in. We’re about to address the elephant in the room. Goldberg is the new universal champion. Goldberg defeated The Fiend in less than 3 minutes. This now means that Goldberg is the only man in WWE history to hold a world title in 4 decades (1998, 2003, 2017 and 2020). The Fiend was taken out by 4 spears and one (and I’m choosing my words carefully) disappointing jackhammer. Let’s sit with these two bits of information for a few seconds. Anger gone? No? I’m still going to proceed…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-03-04/triggered.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;triggered&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, to be somewhat composed it’s important to say, I have no issue with Goldberg. By all accounts and from the TV footage I’ve seen, he’s a genuinely nice man and does a lot for charity. I would be a liar if I didn’t admit that the child in me is overjoyed – I loved Goldberg in WCW. I have so many happy memories watching WCW with family members and bonding over our love for him. We celebrated when he beat Hogan in 1998 to win his first world title. I was so upset when he lost it… I was so happy when he finally showed up in WWE in 2003 and went on to win the World Heavyweight Championship (I was also really, really, unhappy that he was taken out by someone who’s going into the Hall of Fame this year…). I was overjoyed when he went into the hall of fame, and even when he returned. Whilst it may have not been the greatest (due to an accident on his part), past storylines have proven that Goldberg can return to wrestling without being in the title picture. At least he would still prove to his son that he can achieve anything and present his son with the opportunity to see him perform (if that is indeed the true motive of Goldbergs’ return). It’s also important to note that Goldbergs’ age is not a factor in my upset. Goldberg turned 53 in December.  Chris Jericho turned 49 in November and is the current AEW Champion. I adore Le Champion. It is the fact that we have yet another part time, and in my opinion, undeserving champion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I also have no issue with The Fiend losing the title, it must happen at some time or another. That’s the nature of professional wrestling. You win titles and lose them. As wrestling fans, we’ve come to accept this. For me, what is so jarring about this loss, is WHO beat him. If this was a decade ago, it could have been believable – especially as Wyatt was relatively new to the industry, and it would have been a nice way to see Goldberg go out on top. Yet, with the amount of talent at WWEs’ disposal and they choose to have their most compelling Main Roster character lose to a part time superstar? Surely it would have made more sense to have The Fiend lose the title to the next big thing on SmackDown? Especially as The Fiend has previously been booked as unstoppable (from what I’ve seen anyway). The question is, where does The Fiend go from this loss? Especially if the rumours are true and he will face John Cena (again) at Wrestlemania, rather than challenge for the title he’s lost? The Fiend deserves a Wrestlemania moment that makes up for the god-awful match he had against Orton a few years ago. To be fair, I’d like to see The Fiend take on Alistair Black (granted he’s on Raw like) or Bobby Roode (He’ll NEVER be Robert to me) or even Shinsuke Nakamura. Hell, I’d even take Bo Dallas. All of these are people I’ve never seen Bray Wyatt / The Fiend go against before (although you guys will let me know if I’m wrong). These are matches worthy of being on the Wrestlemania Card and could help establish new ‘top stars’ to help establish SmackDown Live! as must see tv. Not to mention helping the blue brand truly be the ‘land of opportunity’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst we’re talking about Wrestlemania, if the rumours are true, I frankly don’t want to see Goldberg vs. Reigns for the title. Essentially, it comes down to spear vs spear. If this is the case, lets add Edge into it. Hell, lets add Batista into it too. Battle of the spears – winner takes all. Because if this is the road WWE are going down, why not go all in? 3 Hall of Famers against the Big Dog. Trying to get back to some level of seriousness, Reigns being out of the title picture has been wonderful – and frankly, he doesn’t need to be at this moment in time. If creative really wanted to give Reigns another Wrestlemania Moment, surely having him represent SmackDown Live in a 3-way Raw vs. SmackDown vs. NXT match would be better? That way, he could claim that he should be the number one contender as he proved SmackDown is the best brand. Or he could claim that SmackDown really is his yard and offer some sort of groundwork for the inevitable post mania shake up? For example, should the Velveteen Dream be called up (please, no, give him the NXT Title first lads) Reigns could easily play the cocky heel and say something along the lines of “I beat &lt;em&gt;insert name here&lt;/em&gt; and sent them back to NXT. You won’t be any different, son”. And if Goldberg has nothing to do over Wrestlemania weekend, I can think of a Bro who has been very vocal about him on social media. Simply put, I want to see Matt Riddle vs. Goldberg. This match would be money – especially as its clear they don’t like each other. This fact alone means no title needs to be near it. Imagine what could happen during this match and how many headlines this could generate. Granted, this takes a lot of professional restraint on behalf of both parties, but surely, I cannot be the only one that is desperate for this match to happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest issues I have with Goldberg winning is the implications for RAW and SmackDown Live. These are considered the two “Top Shows” in WWE and are now led by champions who are part time. It can be argued that this makes these shows must watch to see if the champion shows up. I disagree. I feel that if the company cannot be bothered to have a full-time champion, why should I bother investing my time caring for who has it? Or who the next challenger is? Earlier, I wrote that part time champions don’t deserve it. Why? Because if you’re a champion, you are the best at what you do. You represent a promotion and its values. As champion, you should be proud to hold the title bestowed onto you. You take that title everywhere with you (see Pete Dunne and the NXTUK Title). How can you do this if you’re part time? It is no secret that TV viewership is down, as are ticket sales and PPV buy rates. Could all the above be a factor? I asked this in my last piece, but what impact does a part-time champion have on staff morale?  What message does this send to the full-time members of the roster? What message does it send to the fans, both casual and die-hard, about the top titles in the company? Surely, I can’t be the only one who asks these questions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another issue is that Goldberg has experienced bad booking decisions and their impact. If you cast your mind back to how his WCW streak ended, there were fans who were just as upset as they are today. If memory serves me correctly, in the Monday Night Wars series on the Network, Goldberg is clearly unhappy at the decision to end his streak in WCW when it did. Similarly, he was also booked appallingly in 2003 by WWE and by the time 2004 came, fans were happy to see him go, especially as it felt like he was only there for his paycheck. Surely, he must have known that it wasn’t the right time for The Fiends’ title reign to come to an end, in such a lack lustre way and at a glorified house show. The only circumstances I can see the need for this to be done was if Bray was injured in some way. It comes to something when Scott Hall is posting on Twitter that he should ‘Dust off this taser’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may seem like I’m jumping on the bandwagon and joining other members of the IWC who are up in arms over this. This could be the last time we see Goldberg as an active competitor with the title. But fans have every right to be. It’s no secret that wrestling fans are some of the most avid, passionate and opinionated around. Can you really blame us? Even if we choose to miss NXT or SmackDown Live, we devote 5 hours of our lives each week to watching WWE programming. If we go to the extreme and take in RAW, SmackDown Live, NXT and NXTUK that’s 8 hours of WWE Programming a week. Not to mention the amount of content available on the Network and via alternative outlets such as podcasts – off the top of my head, I can mention 5. Then, there is the amount of merchandise available to fans. I am slightly ashamed to admit this, but I have close to £80 worth of gingerbread ornaments for my Christmas tree. Whilst that amount wasn’t spent all at once, sitting here and doing a quick estimate has made my stomach drop slightly. Not to mention the amount I’ve spent on the Network since 2015 (although, I do not regret having it whilst I was in hospital as it kept me entertained and took my mind off of being ill and in hospital). Despite the amount of time and money the fans part with, the WWE seemingly chooses to ignore them. It is easy to list examples here, and I’m sure you can think of your own. This is the company that once bragged about being “worldwide leader of sports and entertainment”. The company that gave us the Attitude and Ruthless Aggression eras. That made names like Hulk Hogan, The Rock and John Cena into household names – transitioning from Wrestling into pop culture in some way, shape or form. So, the question is, what happened? Whilst its easy to point the finger of blame at the obvious individuals, but please consider the following - the most obvious person for this is allegedly the same person that suggested Rhea Ripley vs Charlotte Flair for Wrestlemania… if you believe the dirt sheets that is. Whilst we now live in an era where there are so many alternatives available to us, and their content is accessible 24/7, for some fans, you never really forget or get over your first love.  It is simply not an option to “go elsewhere”, especially as NXT has proven it can get things so right. Case and point – I’ll probably stay up for NXT Takeover: Tampa rather than Wrestlemania 36. If I don’t, social media will actively be avoided until I watch it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-03-04/goldberg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sgoldberg&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In times like these it is easy to play fantasy booker. It is easy to have 20/20 vision and be able to use the fan reaction we see to influence the matches and outcomes suggested. It’s easy to plan things out without the influences of the likes of performer egos, contracts, politics and the omniscient Vinnie Mac. In all honesty, I didn’t expect Super Showdown to be amongst the calibre of a Wrestlemania X-7 or an NXT Takeover or even a Wrestle Kingdom. Super Showdown was merely a ‘filler’ show to fulfil the requirements of the Saudi deal. I guess that what I expected from this show was to have the seeds planted for Wrestlemania in what is a glorified house show. To a degree, I got what I expected, but not what I wanted. It is comforting to know that I am not alone in being upset over how it ended. I don’t know if I will go to the extremes of cancelling the network, because there two reasons for me to keep it. Had I written this article at 9pm last night (27/02/2020), this article would have been an expletive filled, nonsensical rant that may have been difficult to read. I have had to resist the temptation to rant and include expletives in this one too. Writing this and going on the journey of emotions has been cathartic to say the least. Having reviewed what has been written, I questioned what I felt. The answer was simple – its frustration. I’m frustrated that such silly decisions can be made. I’m frustrated for the full-time members of the WWE Rosters. I’m frustrated for those who are about to be called up from NXT. I’m frustrated that WWE think that it is ok to continuously upset the fans. But the biggest frustration we’ve yet to discuss… Where did the Blue Universal Title come from when The Fiend didn’t walk out with it?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lexi-helms</name></author><summary type="html">Because adding super in front of something makes it more… excitable?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Ep108 - AEW Revolution Review (with Johners &amp;amp; Chris Thornton)</title><link href="/podcasts/EP108/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ep108 - AEW Revolution Review (with Johners &amp; Chris Thornton)" /><published>2020-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/podcasts/EP108</id><content type="html" xml:base="/podcasts/EP108/"></content><author><name>john</name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Ep107 – AEW Revolution Predictions | Jericho &amp;amp; Moxley Weigh-In | Charlotte vs. Belair on NXT | Listeners Q’s</title><link href="/podcasts/EP107/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ep107 – AEW Revolution Predictions | Jericho &amp; Moxley Weigh-In | Charlotte vs. Belair on NXT | Listeners Q’s" /><published>2020-02-29T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-02-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/podcasts/EP107</id><content type="html" xml:base="/podcasts/EP107/"></content><author><name>john</name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Ep106 – BLOOD LOSS &amp;amp; MOONSAULTS | DREAM vs RODDY | What’s Grinding My Gears | Listeners Q’s</title><link href="/podcasts/EP106/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ep106 – BLOOD LOSS &amp; MOONSAULTS | DREAM vs RODDY | What’s Grinding My Gears | Listeners Q’s" /><published>2020-02-22T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-02-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/podcasts/EP106</id><content type="html" xml:base="/podcasts/EP106/"></content><author><name>john</name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Ep105 - Interview with CHANTAL JORDAN (with Turnbuckle TV)</title><link href="/interviews/podcasts/EP105/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ep105 - Interview with CHANTAL JORDAN (with Turnbuckle TV)" /><published>2020-02-19T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-02-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/interviews/podcasts/EP105</id><content type="html" xml:base="/interviews/podcasts/EP105/"></content><author><name>john</name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Is welfare a priority for wrestling promotions?</title><link href="/articles/welfare-in-wrestling/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Is welfare a priority for wrestling promotions?" /><published>2020-02-19T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-02-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/articles/welfare-in-wrestling</id><content type="html" xml:base="/articles/welfare-in-wrestling/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-a-time-where-wrestling-promotions-are-alleged-to-be-at-war-is-welfare-a-priority-for-promotions&quot;&gt;In a time where wrestling promotions are alleged to be at war, is welfare a priority for promotions?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I started 2020 with a prescription for antibiotics for an ear infection… it’s now February and, lo and behold, I’m still ill. This is the reason why I’ve not been as active on the article front as I’d have liked. This 6-ish weeks of being ill (ear infections combined with anaemia and other issues) have forced me to look at my life and attempt to make changes to introduce habits that enable me to take ‘me time’. This, I must admit, has been difficult. For example, I’m attempting to set aside 10 minutes a day to practice a new technique to help me to relax. Doing so makes me feel incredibly guilty and I sometimes think of ways this time could be ‘better spent’. If this is difficult for me, with my ‘regular’ job and writing articles as a hobby, it made wonder how difficult this would be to do when travelling from state to state, country to country, being involved in press and publicity tours, working out and attempting to learn and improve in such a physical profession. Presumably, it must get harder for talent to make such time between January – April, considering its officially Wrestlemania season. Arguably the most important time for wrestling fans and performers alike. During this time, so much happens in terms of storylines, promotion tours, PPVs etc, that these first few months of the wrestling year seemingly pass within a blink of an eye. This year, it seems more intense, especially with new promotions and competition on the scene and the presumed one-upmanship that accompanies such changes. If we as wrestling fans struggle to make time for ourselves, it must be asked, how can promotions make welfare a priority?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I continue, it’s important to clarify a few things – when I discuss wellness or welfare, I mean both the mental and physical happiness of the wrestlers as, for me, these have equal importance. I also do not know the ins and outs of being a professional wrestler and the demands placed on them by companies; if any. The ‘demands’ I allude to throughout this has been assumed based off what I’ve seen in documentaries, magazines, interviews, etc. and the application of common sense. As with most articles, I will attempt to keep this as generic as I can and attempt not to single out one promotion over another. However, it’s important to admit here that I am pretty much an exclusive WWE viewer so whilst I may use more examples from WWE this is in no way aimed directly at them or their practices. It’s also important to remember, that some of the responsibility for welfare and wellbeing needs to be placed onto the performers themselves – after all, they know themselves better than anyone else!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-02-19/mauro.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;mauro&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were two catalysts for this article, and both centre around WWE and their conduct. The first one was their conflicting attitudes and treatment of staff with mental health conditions. Of course, this is where we discuss the treatment of Mauro Ranallo during his tenures with the company. Mauro has openly discussed his bipolar on social media and via his documentary “Bipolar Rock N’ Roller”. Given that Mauro is an advocate for mental health, it would be easy to assume that the company would factor this in when dealing with any issue that arises concerning him. Yet in March 2017 Mauro disappeared from commentary for Smack Down Live. Despite the explanations given by WWE at the time, it was clear that something wasn’t quite right. Then accusations of bullying started circulating, identifying JBL as the culprit. From the outside it felt like nothing was done. Fair play to the fans, they started chanting “fire JBL” and cancelling their network subscriptions in protest, but even this wasn’t enough to trigger WWE to act. Whilst the bullying accusations have been denied on both Mauro and JBLs part, who has since decreased his appearances on WWE programming, there was still enough rumours and anecdotes that negatively portrayed JBL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst Mauro eventually returned to WWE on their NXT brand two years later WWE found themselves in another controversy involving Mauro and another staff member. This time, it was Corey Graves. The platform was more public, as Corey had made unprovoked negative comments seemingly aimed at Mauro via Twitter. Again, Mauro missed work and has deleted his social media accounts. Whilst Corey has apologised via his podcast, admitting that it wasn’t the most professional of moves to make, Mauro has still not returned to social media, but has (thankfully) returned to commentary on NXT. Yet again, from the outside, it seems that WWE have done nothing to tackle this. What’s even more upsetting is that Corey himself has experienced mental health conditions, even tweeting about them on World Mental Health Day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-02-19/cory-tweet.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;cory tweet&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazingly, fans defended Mauro publicly via Twitter and other social media outlets. With many fans commenting that the unprovoked nature of Corey’s comments seemingly made the situation worse. In the aftermath that followed, rumours circulated that WWE Officials backstage believed that Corey is the wronged party in this situation, especially as he was playing up to the brand rivalry element of Survivor Series. The issue? It appears that no one told Mauro that this was part of the storyline. Surely, if this was the case someone should have mentioned it to him? Interestingly, Corey’s’ tweets from November 23rd surrounding Mauro have been deleted, but you can easily find them via google or the screen shots floating about Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irrespective of how we view JBL, Corey and Mauro, given our knowledge of the mental health conditions of two of the individuals, as a repercussion for both situations, WWE should have been seen to act whilst it ‘investigated’? Even if no action was taken? This would, from a PR perspective, sent the message that WWE truly valued the mental wellbeing of its staff. It would have made it loud and clear that overall welfare of its employees is imperative to them. They could have been seen to embrace the positive changes surrounding mental health currently happening in our society. As wrestling is a male dominated profession, acting on both incidents could have encouraged others (especially males) to openly discuss their mental health. Instead, WWE was seemingly hasty to silence the situation in the hopes that it died down on its own. Inevitably, it did – but this whole situation could have easily been avoided had WWE been more proactive in its approach to dealing with bullying allegations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other was the rumour that Bray Wyatt would face Kane in an inferno match at the upcoming Super Showdown event. I’ll try not to get too political or make WWE the easy targets on this issue, it is worth considering that WWEs behaviour on this one issue alone seems to contradict other points I will raise later in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have seen this image I shared to the Wrestling With Johners Facebook Page back in January:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-02-19/fiend-kane.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;fiend kane&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first saw the image and the rumour that this would be an inferno match, my initial thought was “really? In the heat of Saudi Arabia?” I was reminded of previous concerns raised regarding the temperatures of Saudi Arabia and if performers would be able to cope in them. I also had concerns as to whether this event would be held in an open-air arena, increasing the possibility for injury due to unpredictable weather. Let’s not forget that The Undertaker famously suffered second-degree burns during his entrance before the Elimination Chamber match in 2010. This was due to a pyro malfunction but was conducted in a ‘controlled environment’ and an arena with a roof. I dread to think what could happen if there was a malfunction in an open-air arena during an inferno match. Surely, I can’t be the only one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the scheduled 27th February show will be conducted in much cooler temperatures than previous events, as Crown Jewel falls in October / November which is the hotter months on average, I’m sure I wasn’t alone in being concerned about the performers welfare should an inferno match happen at an event in Saudi Arabia.  Whilst it’s now mid-February and we know this won’t happen, due to Goldberg challenging the Fiend, the thought of an inferno match in such unpredictable conditions still makes me uncomfortable, especially as wrestling isn’t like football or rugby – there is no one waiting on the touch lines with water, ready to run on and hand out drinks to help keep performers hydrated and, whilst it may be scripted, it would somewhat ruin the suspension of belief if the ref were to call for a ‘water break’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking of the other complaints that have arisen from the Saudi Arabia shows (and I’ll mention a few, but not all); from the controversy caused by showing of a trailer featuring female performers (granted, women were not allowed to perform at the time of it being broadcast, but surely it must have been made clear that this was a worldwide broadcast and not just in Jeddah); political tensions both internationally and amongst the talents who ended up refusing to perform on the show; to the travel issues caused after the 2019 Crown Jewel show, surely the above would be enough to make WWE reconsider this deal. It can be argued that continuing with it sends a clear message not only to the talent but to the fans. The objective is to make money rather than listen to the concerns or prioritise the wellbeing of performers. John Oliver pointed out that for a crowd to turn on The Undertaker when cutting a promo shows just how upset the fans are with the situation – whatever their reason for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving away from WWE for a while, other promotions should not be ignored when it comes to controversy surrounding the welfare of performers. The match between Omega and Moxley at AEW Full Gear in 2019 was one of the more controversial matches of recent times. From the barbed wire bed frame; the glass table spot; to the bloodshed and the investigation that followed it, this was enough for mainstream media outlets to become aware of and discuss it. To us wrestling fans, although divided in opinions, we can often agree that this match is tame in comparison to other promotions and matches, especially those involving Moxley. A quick internet search will provide access to the CZW Tournament of Death archives featuring Moxley. There are more famous death matches that I can mention, such as the Mick Foley vs Terry Funk King of the Deathmatch 1995 finals, but they are a difficult watch. I have said before that death matches are not my thing – I understand their appeal and respect anyone who works them, but I become too uncomfortable watching them, possibly due to my own anxieties regarding pain or because I am genuinely concerned for the welfare of the performers. How far is too far when it comes to deathmatches? Given the past decade of changes that have happened within professional wrestling it can be argued that death matches need to become a thing of the past if performer welfare is truly made a priority within promotions. (I know it won’t happen, as they’re always a draw, but it does need to be asked).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst were here, it is also worth considering if it’s time for the impact of Strong Style on wrestlers to be looked at from a welfare perspective. Whilst there is no doubt in my mind that all styles of wrestling hurt and will leave a mark, Strong Style seems to hurt more. I know that that’s what its intended to do, especially given the respect placed onto professional wrestling within Japan, where this style originates. For example, the crowd are largely silent during matches – a stark contrast to some American and British fans. It’s no secret that Strong Style causes divided opinions amongst fans – yet another reason to love this crazy industry! Whilst I love watching Strong Style (if I’m being honest, I’ve not seen that much of it) and respect any of the performers who use this style, it can sometimes be brutal to watch. If we look at the broken neck Hiromu Takahashi’s suffered during his match against Dragon Lee at the G1 Special in July 2018, not only do I wince and hold my breath every time I see it (and let out several expletives), but I instantly respect Takahashi a lot more because of his ability to finish the match yet alone walk backstage and eventually return to wrestling in 2020. However, it also raises questions. It is one thing for a performer to say they’re ok, but what if they’re not being truthful to themselves or their colleagues’? Whilst I don’t know if the seriousness of the injury was apparent at the time, surely it would have been a wise decision to stop the match as soon as the move had ended and had Takahashi taken to hospital immediately from the ring? It may be argued that this action alone undermines the principals of Strong Style, but surely, it’s better to be cautious, especially when it concerns a neck injury? Again, I’m left asking how far is too far? What is the mental impact of Strong Style on a performer, especially if in constant pain? (I know this won’t happen, but I must play devil’s advocate… right?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, there seems to be slithers of change immerging from promotions. One of the biggest ones is AEWs’ announcement in 2019 that all talents will begin on the same rate of pay. Whilst this is not directly related to welfare per se, I can only imagine that this has done wonders for the morale of the locker room, especially the female half. New talents to the company will see that they are equal – they do the same job, take similar risks to perform, in the same company, attend the same shows… so why not? It is literally their gender that separates them. Granted, things like experience comes into play, but as Brandi Rhodes herself explained it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-02-19/brandi-tweet.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;brandi tweet&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another encouraging change is the fact that issues like this are being addressed so publicly. The wrestling industry was once shrouded in mystery that only the ‘hardcore’ fans were in the know. This has continued to change – from Mean Genes’ Hotline, to internet-based dirt sheets to podcasts (to name but a few) the industry is more exposed than ever. Whilst it can be argued that addressing of the gender pay gap is merely AEW doing everything they can to please the fans and make it stand out against WWE, it is one hell of a statement to make. It could lead to other promotions falling in line to ensure they are on the same level – especially if things continue to be as competitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other issues such as the #GiveDivasAChance movement in 2015 that trended and started the ‘Women’s Evolution’ that we now see in WWE. This movement can be argued that it was simply a ploy by WWE to placate the fans and establish damage limitations – especially in the wake of AJ Lee calling out Stephanie McMahon on Twitter, raising concerns over pay issues and screen time. From a female perspective, women’s wrestling in WWE alone has come a long way in close to 5 years. Its not perfect… see Lana / Rusev / Lashley, but for every misstep there is a Becky Lynch, Shayna Baszler, Bianca Belair and Toni Storm (to name a few) that give glimmers of hope. There are other promotions that continue to raise the bar when it comes to Women’s Wrestling. The likes of World Wonder Ring Stardom, Women of Honour, Impact Wrestling, ICW and Progress all offer viable alternatives. Hell, at the time of writing this, the current Impact Wrestling world champion is none other than Tessa Blanchard. This can be nothing but good for the welfare of female performers – especially as there are now bigger and bolder goals to aim for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-02-19/tessa.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;tessa&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example of change is the portrayal of real injuries during a live broadcast. During the Worlds Collide Tournament in January 2020, Alexander Wolfe was knocked out during the main event of Imperium vs Undisputed Era. The footage is available online and a simple internet search will take you to it. Whilst this is professional wrestling, the performers take risks and there is a chance that things can go wrong, the way this incident was portrayed on WWE TV was different. The Referee Drake Younger (ironically another CZW Tournament of Death Alumni) notices something is not right during the pin and stops counting, pushing Bobby Fish off so he can get a closer look at Wolfe. Before you know it, the ‘X’ is thrown up and the reaction of everyone – those in the ring, the stunned silence of the crowd to those on commentary lets you at home know something is not right. Wolfe was quickly removed from the ring and the match continued, albeit with a slightly sombre tone. Wolfe did tweet later to say that he was fine, it was his own fault and thanking Drake and WWE Medical staff for their help. The way Alexander Wolfe’s situation was handled is a stark contrast to how Enzo Amore’s injury was treated during the Payback PPV in 2016. The audience was treated to several replays of Enzo being knocked out – both at home and in the arena. Irrespective of your opinions towards Enzo as a person, this was difficult to watch. A legitimate knock out to a human being. There was, IMO anyway, no need to have that many replays of it. Where appropriate, replays can be a good thing – Titus World-Slide, for example. Please, WWE replay it to your hearts content… but a knockout… no. Just no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more positively, look at WWEs’ treatment of Lars Sullivan and his anxiety. According to sources, it was a panic attack that initially stopped his debut on the main roster in 2019. I have an anxiety disorder that can result in panic attacks, so I can absolutely sympathise with anyone who has them. Although everyone is different, panic attacks are scary; they make you think you can’t breathe; you think your heart will explode because its beating so fast; that you’re going to pass out at best or at worse you will die; they make you embarrassed, forgetful, and tired; you can be on edge for hours after, if you’re unlucky; if you’re lucky they happen in private and last minutes (but this feels like hours). They are no laughing matter. Irrespective of the trigger for Sullivan’s’ attack – some sources imply it was stage fright others suggest that the trigger was the knowledge that his poor conduct on social media was about to resurface. Putting feelings towards these comments aside for a moment, in my opinion, WWE made the right decision to take Sullivan out of the situation and let him address the anxiety. Although a person will never be anxiety free (it is normal to have anxiety from time to time), hopefully the right treatment for Sullivan was sought – be it medication, counselling or Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (to name a few). Although Sullivan is now injured and therefore off TV, it will be a case of waiting and seeing if this issue is now fully resolved. It will be interesting over the next few months and years to see how prepared promotions are when it comes to helping superstars cope with mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a PR perspective, every wrestling promotion would love to be praised for truly putting the performers wellbeing at the centre of what they do. In an ideal world, performers wellbeing would be prioritised over anything else – be it ratings to revenue. As discussed throughout this article, there are some promotions that are better at it than others, just like there are certain businesses that excel at one aspect compared to another and vice versa. It is interesting that some of these promotions are newer than others, meaning one could make the argument that the newer promotions are not stuck in their ways. Importantly, positive changes are happening and, even if they may not be directly related to welfare, the positive impact on the morale of performers must make a difference. An issue this big is going to take time; promotions may make mistakes along the way and it is worth noting that whilst one method may work for one company, it may not be possible for others to follow suit. With that in mind, there is still a long way to go before wellbeing is truly made a priority for some wrestling promotions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lexi-helms</name></author><summary type="html">In a time where wrestling promotions are alleged to be at war, is welfare a priority for promotions?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Ep104 - NXT TakeOver Portland FULL REVIEW (with Mags @BadLandsPod)</title><link href="/podcasts/EP104/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ep104 - NXT TakeOver Portland FULL REVIEW (with Mags @BadLandsPod)" /><published>2020-02-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-02-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/podcasts/EP104</id><content type="html" xml:base="/podcasts/EP104/"></content><author><name>john</name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry></feed>
