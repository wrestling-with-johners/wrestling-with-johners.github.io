&lt;h2 id=&quot;aoife-valkaryie-vs-amale&quot;&gt;AOIFE VALKARYIE Vs. AMALE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debut time here. My first g;impse of Aoife. She was impressive with some really good moves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-02-16/valkarie.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;valkarie&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe she will go after the women‚Äôs UK title at some point. Ok opening match. Amale loses in this opener.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WINNER OF THE MATCH: AOIFE VALKARYIE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dave-mastiff-vs-saxon-huxley&quot;&gt;DAVE MASTIFF Vs. SAXON HUXLEY&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-02-16/mastiff.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;mastiff&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mastiff dominates most of this match. Huxley getting little offense in. Basically a squash match here but Mastiff wants Walter, and this was his message to the current NXT UK champ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WINNER OF THE MATCH: DAVE MASTIFF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out come the Grizzled Young Veterans. Zack Gibson cuts a good promo explaining how they believe they have been treated unfairly by NXTUK GM Johnny Saint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-02-16/gyv.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;gyv&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;joe-coffey-vs-amir-jordan&quot;&gt;JOE COFFEY Vs. AMIR JORDAN&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again mostly another squash match. A new attitude from Joe Coffey during this match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-02-16/coffey.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;coffey&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to much for me to say here. Amir takes the loss in this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WINNER OF THE MATCH: JOE COFFEY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the match Joe cuts a promo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gallus-vs-oney-lorcan-and-danny-burch&quot;&gt;GALLUS Vs. ONEY LORCAN AND DANNY BURCH&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hard hitting match here. Strong style throughout the match. I think the wrong people won here, but it is what it is. Once again a new attitude from Gallus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WINNER OF THE MATCH: GALLUS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the match Ilja Dragunov came out but got attacked by Gallus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-02-16/gallus-ilja.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;gallus-ilja&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I give it a 7 out of 10. It was a good episode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were no details provided on why he will be appearing on the show, but it could be related to WrestleMania. Cena has indicated that he would like to have a role in this year‚Äôs WrestleMania. However in a recent tweet Cena has stated that he will be on Smackdown to promote his latsest movie ‚ÄòThe Invisible Man‚Äô.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Thank you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/WWE?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@WWE&lt;/a&gt; for allowing me the opportunity to come to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Smackdown?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Smackdown&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/WWEonFOX?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@WWEonFOX&lt;/a&gt; to promote a project nearly 20 years in the making. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/InvisibleMan?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#InvisibleMan&lt;/a&gt; üñêüòÅ &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/vN3FcK8RN2&quot;&gt;https://t.co/vN3FcK8RN2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/OWqhxUPyB6&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/OWqhxUPyB6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; John Cena (@JohnCena) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JohnCena/status/1227569624868425729?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 12, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is believed that Cena has been booked to appear on Smackdown on February 28 not only to promote his movie, but also to set up a possible match for WrestleMania. Please note that that this episode of Smackdown will air the night following Super-Showdown, from Saudi Arabia. With Cena potentially being lined up as a big name back-up, in case there are any ‚ÄòFlight Delays‚Äô similar to the WWE‚Äôs last visit to Saudi Arabia, in October 2019.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>john</name></author><summary type="html">On last night‚Äôs WWE Backstage on FOX it was announced that John Cena will be making his WWE return, appearing on Friday Night SmackDown on February 28 in Boston, MA.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Ep102 ‚Äì 10 LASHES FOR CODY | Velveteen Returns | The Queen on NXT | All NEW Features (with Mags @BadlandsPod)</title><link href="/podcasts/EP102/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ep102 ‚Äì 10 LASHES FOR CODY | Velveteen Returns | The Queen on NXT | All NEW Features (with Mags @BadlandsPod)" /><published>2020-02-08T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-02-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/podcasts/EP102</id><content type="html" xml:base="/podcasts/EP102/"></content><author><name>john</name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">‚ÄòTransformative‚Äô Changes Ahead For WWE Network</title><link href="/news/Major-changes-to-WWE-network/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="'Transformative' Changes Ahead For WWE Network" /><published>2020-02-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-02-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/news/Major-changes-to-WWE-network</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/Major-changes-to-WWE-network/">&lt;p&gt;On Thursday‚Äôs investors conference call, WWE chairman Vince McMahon said the company has had advanced talks with major OTT players (alternative streaming services) about changes to the WWE Network that could mean a significant revenue increase for the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McMahon called the potential deals ‚Äútransformative‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-02-07/network.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;network&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those changes could be content rights with marquee events like WrestleMania and the Royal Rumble or perhaps a different distribution model for the WWE Network altogether. McMahon said if a change is made, it will be announced this quarter as the talks are that far along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked about the plans for the Network, McMahon said they have a lot of options. One is to remain as they are now with a free and paid tier while the other is to distribute more content to ‚Äúthe majors‚Äù. He later clarified ‚Äúmajors‚Äù as OTT companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could mean that some or all of WWE‚Äôs LIVE Pay-Per-Views will no longer be available on the WWE Network. With the possibility of WrestleMania and Royal Rumble only being available via an alternative ‚ÄòPaid Service‚Äô.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no better time as of right now to exercise the selling of our rights,‚Äù he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a follow-up answer, interim CFO Frank Riddick said that while the devil is in the details, there is nothing that would stop them from selling those rights if they chose to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McMahon was asked about whether they would consider adding advertising to the Network and he said they would be interested if they kept the model as is. If they brought on other partners, that decision would be up to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of last quarter, the WWE Network had 1.43 million subscribers worldwide, a 10% drop from the previous quarter, and generated $184.6 million in yearly revenue, down $15 million from 2018. The company predicted a modest increase for Q1 2020 for 1.47 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WWE signed two massive five-year TV deals with both Fox (SmackDown) and NBCUniversal (Raw), giving the company $2.35 billion from 2019-2024.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>john</name></author><summary type="html">On Thursday‚Äôs investors conference call, WWE chairman Vince McMahon said the company has had advanced talks with major OTT players (alternative streaming services) about changes to the WWE Network that could mean a significant revenue increase for the company.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">NXT UK Review - 6th February 2020</title><link href="/articles/NXT-Review-6th-February-2020/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="NXT UK Review - 6th February 2020" /><published>2020-02-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-02-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/articles/NXT%20Review%206th%20February%202020</id><content type="html" xml:base="/articles/NXT-Review-6th-February-2020/">&lt;p&gt;WWE NXT UK Review - February 6th 2020&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;piper-niven-vs-dani-luna&quot;&gt;PIPER NIVEN Vs. DANI LUNA&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok match to start. Piper really needs to build up those wins again. Not to much else to be said here. Dani unsuccessful on this occasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-02-07/piper-luna.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;piper luna&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WINNER OF THE MATCH: PIPER NIVEN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tyler-bate-vs-a-kid&quot;&gt;TYLER BATE Vs. A-KID&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-02-07/tyler-akid.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;tyler akid&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a match between Mentor vs Student in this one. Good match. Great back and fourth action. Kid gave Tyler his all unfortunately he seems to have become a more of an Enhancement talent. But it is early days for A-Kid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WINNER OF THE MATCH: TYLER BATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the match Joesph Connors came out and cut a promo on Tyler. Setting up a possible feud between these two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pretty-deadly-vs-ashton-smith-and-oliver-carter&quot;&gt;PRETTY DEADLY Vs. ASHTON SMITH AND OLIVER CARTER&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty Deadly consist of Sam Stoker and Lewis Howley. I have actually met Stoker at PCW. Both these tag teams need the win. This was a good match here. Pretty Deadly take the loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-02-07/carter.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;carter&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WINNER OF THE MATCH: OLIVER CARTER AND ASHTON SMITH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out comes Kay Lee Ray to cut a promo. KLR is interupted by Toni Storm. They will have an I quit match for the NXT title at some point soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-02-07/toni-klr.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;toni klr&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MAIN EVENT‚Ä¶.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;eddie-dennis-vs-trent-seven---in-the-first-ever-steel-corners-street-fight&quot;&gt;EDDIE DENNIS Vs. TRENT SEVEN - IN THE FIRST EVER STEEL CORNERS STREET FIGHT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my first time seeing a match like this. NXT UK seem to a have a lot of firsts. Good match right here. They fought everywhere and into the crowd. Steel steps were involved. What a match. They fought to the announce table and Trent puts Eddie through a table. Very brutal. Hard hitting action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-02-07/trent-eddie.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;trent eddie&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion the wrong person won.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WINNER OF THE MATCH: TRENT SEVEN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I give it 8 out of 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a very good episode of NXT UK this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news was first announced by Justin Barrasso of Sports Illustrated. Barrasso spoke to AEW President &amp;amp; CEO Tony Khan, who touted the success the company has had since the first Double Or Nothing pay-per-view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúLast May, we sparked a revolution with our inaugural Double or Nothing pay-per-view event in Las Vegas,‚Äù Khan said. ‚ÄúDouble or Nothing rocked the wrestling industry and led to Wednesday Night Dynamite, a top-rated weekly show on TNT reaching millions of viewers worldwide, and over 140,000 live event tickets sold to date.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Khan continued, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been an incredible run, and only fitting that we return to Las Vegas to celebrate our one year anniversary with AEW‚Äôs marquee event. On Saturday, May 23, Double or Nothing is back for round two at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.

&lt;p&gt;After many weeks of speculation Ryan Satin confirmed on WWE Backstage that Killer Kross has signed with the company. It is not clear which brand Kross will appear on first. Although it is expected that Kross will join the NXT brand and appear on NXT weekly TV within the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-02-05/kross.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;killer kross&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also confirmed last night that another Indy superstar, Timothy Thatcher has signed with WWE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-02-05/timothey.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;killer kross&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thatcher is well-known for wrestling on the Indy circuit around the States and Europe, and is also renowned for being a former stable-mate of Walter and Marcel Barthell, as part of Ring Kampf in wXw in Germany. Similar to Kross, it is expected that Thatcher will join the Black &amp;amp; Gold brand within the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expect new ring names for both wrestlers when they officially make their TV debuts.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>john</name></author><summary type="html">As announced on last night‚Äôs WWE Backstage on FS1, former IMPACT and Lucha Underground wrestler Killer Kross has officially signed with WWE.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Ep101 - KEVIN ISAAC Interview (Independent Wrestling Elite UK)</title><link href="/interviews/podcasts/EP101/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ep101 - KEVIN ISAAC Interview (Independent Wrestling Elite UK)" /><published>2020-02-04T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-02-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/interviews/podcasts/EP101</id><content type="html" xml:base="/interviews/podcasts/EP101/"></content><author><name>john</name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Charlotte to answer Rhea‚Äôs challenge on this week‚Äôs NXT</title><link href="/news/Ripley-confronts-Charlotte-on-Raw/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Charlotte to answer Rhea's challenge on this week's NXT" /><published>2020-02-04T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-02-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/news/Ripley%20confronts%20Charlotte%20on%20Raw</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/Ripley-confronts-Charlotte-on-Raw/">&lt;p&gt;On last night‚Äôs Monday Night RAW Charlotte Flair conducted an in-ring promo to address which championship she will be challenging for as the Royal Rumble winner, at WrestleMania 36 on 5th April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-02-04/rhea-charlotte.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;charlotte &amp;amp; ripley&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charlotte announced that ‚ÄúShe has held the RAW Women‚Äôs championship multiple times and has beaten Becky‚Äù and that ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs held the Smackdown Women‚Äôs champion multiple times and has beaten Bailey‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-02-04/charlotte.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;charlotte&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the fans in the arena started to chant NXT, Charlotte said that ‚ÄúThe Queen has love for NXT and NXT has love for the Queen‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-02-04/rhea.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ripley&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current NXT Women‚Äôs champion Ripley came out to address Charlotte. Ripley told Charlotte ‚ÄúThat The Queen has already beaten Becky and Bailey. But she has not beaten her‚Äù. Ripley continued by saying that she has however beaten the Queen, as Charlotte walked out of the ring, with Ripley holding her NXT gold above her head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the evening it was announced that Charlotte will be on NXT this Wednesday on the USA Network, to address Rhea Ripley‚Äôs challenge and to announce which title she will be challenging for at WrestleMania 36.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the storyline would suggest it looks certain that the Women‚Äôs NXT Championship will be defended at WrestleMania, with Charlotte going up against current NXT Women‚Äôs champion Rhea Ripley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs not forget that Ripley will be defending her NXT Championship on 16th February at NXT Takeover Portland against current No.1 contender Bianca Belair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could also see Charlotte make a cameo apperence during the Ripley vs. Belair match in Portland, further setting up their match for Mania 36.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with Belair‚Äôs very strong showing at this year‚Äôs Royal Rumble I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see Belair featured in a WrestleMania match as well. With the possibility of the NXT Women‚Äôs championship match becoming a Triple-Threat match between all three.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>john</name></author><summary type="html">On last night‚Äôs Monday Night RAW Charlotte Flair conducted an in-ring promo to address which championship she will be challenging for as the Royal Rumble winner, at WrestleMania 36 on 5th April.</summary></entry></feed>
