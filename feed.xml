<h1 id="progress-chapter-143-the-deadly-viper-tour--codename-sidewinder">Progress Chapter 143: The Deadly Viper Tour – Codename: Sidewinder</h1>

<p>We’re kicking things off with a belated Progress recap. Plus, even though a sidewinder is a type of snake, I—for some reason—think of “Rogue Trip: Vacation 2012” (a comedic parody of the “Twisted Metal” franchise) where one of the vehicles is named Sidewinder.</p>

<p>Videogame nostalgia aside, the 143rd chapter of Progress took place on October 9, 2022 at the O2 Arena in Manchester, England in the United Kingdom; it also served as the fourth part of the Deadly Viper Tour. Nine matches were on the card including two quarterfinal round matches that were part of the Natural Progression Series tournament, a match that featured a returning Progress wrestler that competed in NXT UK in the past, and a brand-new match—known as Super Mob Smash 12—that looked like a cross between a fatal four-way tag match and a trios match mainly because all four teams consisted of three wrestlers each.</p>

<p>The aforementioned Super Mob Smash 12 was indeed a fun bout to watch, even with high flying and “blink and you’ll miss it” moments coming from all twelve competitors that were in this match along with some comedic moments. Yes, it was hard to keep an eye on who was going after whom at times, but it still fun while it lasted.</p>

<p>Not only did I enjoy this match, but there were also two others after ranking them from fair to very good; one was the opening match between Millie McKenzie—whom we saw return one chapter ago—and Alexxis Falcon. Millie, even though I’m two chapters in, appears to be on the roll as of late ever since returning to Progress; Alexxis—a fan favorite as well as my favorite—on the other hand still gives her opponents a run for their money, even in matches where there is no gold on the line.</p>

<p>The other match that I enjoyed became my favorite of this chapter, and it served as part of the quarterfinal round of the Natural Progression Series tournament; in this match were two wrestlers that are not related despite having the same last name, and they were Liam and Leon Slater. Both wrestlers—or Slaters if you will—fought tooth and nail while being aware that advancing to the next round was on the line, and in the end, it was Leon who picked up his career first Progress win. Leon has shown us that he has more in store in his pro wrestling career even in Progress; he definitely has a bright future in that sport for sure.</p>

<p>Here are the match results from Manchester…</p>

<h2 id="match-1-millie-mckenzie-defeated-alexxis-falcon">Match #1: Millie McKenzie defeated Alexxis Falcon.</h2>
<p>Beating poor Olie Spring to the punch, I do remember Millie and Alexxis competing in their last one-on-one match; the last time they did so was in 2021 in the Theatre Peckham in London, England. After Millie blocked the Falcon’s Fury, she hit Alexxis with an uppercut and a cutter for two before Alexxis came back with a Twist of Fate for two, a snapmare neckbreaker for two, and the Falcon’s Fury for a near fall. Then, Millie hit her with a basement dropkick followed by a spear for the win. Both wrestlers shook hands afterwards before Alexxis raised Millie’s arm. <strong>My score: 4/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-2-elijah-defeated-tom-dawkins">Match #2: Elijah defeated Tom Dawkins.</h2>
<p>This was Dawkins’ first match without his Cara Noir alter ego; he felt reluctant coming into the ring and competing as a plain vanilla wrestler. Spike Trivet, with Bullit, appeared at the entryway and told Dawkins to take off his Cara Noir t-shirt; he would then stop Dawkins from attempting any of his Cara Noir maneuvers such as the Swan Woo.</p>

<p>After Elijah hit Dawkins with the Graveyard Smash for a near fall, Dawkins hit him with a powerbomb for two and went for a package driver until Trivet stopped him again; Dawkins instead put Elijah in a cross armbreaker and gave the “sovereign lord” the “number one salute” until Elijah fought out of the hold and won with the Danger Buster. Afterwards, Trivet coerced Dawkins to leave while Elijah stood in the ring and saw the lights go out with his music video and theme song going awry, SMPTE color bars, numeric code and all; Elijah looked confused afterwards as soon as the lights went back on. <strong>My score: 2/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-3-tate-mayfairs-defeated-sam-bailey-in-the-quarterfinal-round-of-the-natural-progression-series-tournament">Match #3: Tate Mayfairs defeated Sam Bailey in the quarterfinal round of the Natural Progression Series tournament.</h2>
<p>This was Manchester native Bailey’s debut. Before the match started, Simon Miller was trying not to laugh while introducing Mayfairs until Mayfairs called him a “stupid idiot” and then called Manchester a “b-town”; Miller looked flustered and took off his Progress jacket before announcing Bailey’s intro. During the match, Mayfairs beat down Bailey and—after saying “Tate-ness is greatness”—performed a Spinaroonie until Bailey booted him and hit him with a blockbuster for two; Bailey then attempted to dropkick Mayfairs in the corner, but missed and ended up getting tangled on the top rope, allowing Mayfairs to hit him with a coast-to-coast double axe handle for two. Near the end, Mayfairs grabbed brass knuckles from under the ring, and Bailey went after him until almost hitting referee LK; Bailey then rolled up Mayfairs—who grabbed one of the turnbuckle covers—for two and, when LK went to fix the cover, Mayfairs hit him with the knuckles before incapacitating him with a sleeper/bodyscissors combo for the win. <strong>My score: 2.5/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-4-nina-samuels-defeated-taonga">Match #4: Nina Samuels defeated Taonga.</h2>
<p>The last time Nina was in Progress was in chapter 94 where she lost in the last round of the Revelations of Divine Love tournament to Impact wrestler Jordynne Grace in 2019. After Nina blocked the I’m Prettier, Taonga hit Nina with an armbreaker and a running knee for two, then Nina pretended to be unconscious before rolling her up for two; then, Nina blocked the I’m Prettier again and grabbed Taonga by the hair before hitting her with a roundhouse kick and winning with the Starstruck (ushigoroshi).</p>

<p>After the match, Nina said that Progress needed “more Nina” and poked fun of the fans for not having high standards, then had a crewman give her a “Nina Samuels Award”—a small pink trophy—and declared herself the winner of that award; Alexxis Falcon appeared and called the award a “shit little trophy”, then said that she and the rest of the women built the division while Nina was away, and then vowed to take the award and shove it up Nina’s ass. <strong>My score: 2.5/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-5-kid-lykos-w-kid-lykos-ii-defeated-luke-jacobs-w-ethan-allen">Match #5: Kid Lykos (w/ Kid Lykos II) defeated Luke Jacobs (w/ Ethan Allen).</h2>
<p>Allen his healing from his injuries for the rest of the year. During the match, after KL hit Jacobs with a Casanova kick and a Swanton for a near fall, Jacobs fought back and then knocked KL2 off the apron; he then fought both members of Lykos Gym at ringside, and then hit KL2 and KL with half-and-half suplexes into the chairs in the audience. The end of the match saw Jacobs hit KL with a top rope splash for two until KL surprised him with a small package for the win. <strong>My score: 2.75/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-6-leon-slater-defeated-liam-slater-in-the-quarterfinal-round-of-the-natural-progression-series-tournament">Match #6: Leon Slater defeated Liam Slater in the quarterfinal round of the Natural Progression Series tournament.</h2>
<p>Both shook hands and hugged as soon as the bell rang. During the match, Leon went for a tope con giro until Liam ran back to the ring; Liam then hit Leon with a chop block and then worked on his opponent’s right knee. Leon came back and then won with a 450 splash. Both men hugged afterwards, and Liam raised Leon’s arm; then, Leon—due to his knee being worked on—was helped to the back by a crewman. <strong>My score: 4.25/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-7-maverick-mayhew-omari--mike-bird-defeated-joe-lando-callum-newman--danny-black-and-vaughn-vertigo-keinen-krishna--tu-byt-and-gene-munny--the-sunshine-machine-in-super-mob-smash-12">Match #7: Maverick Mayhew, Omari &amp; Mike Bird defeated Joe Lando, Callum Newman &amp; Danny Black and Vaughn Vertigo, Keinen Krishna &amp; Tu Byt and Gene Munny &amp; the Sunshine Machine in Super Mob Smash 12.</h2>
<p>The teams of three were selected by the fans, two wrestlers started the match and would tag anyone they want, and the winner of the match would get a championship opportunity of his choosing. Mayhew jokingly wanted to team with the rest of CPF until Mayhew was sent to the back because he wasn’t teaming with the three. Also, this was Tu Byt’s debut; he represented North West Strong. Plus, Munny did a Big E-like intro for the Sunshine Machine; as soon as Chuck Mambo and TK Cooper appeared, it was beachball mania as there were beachballs bouncing from the entryway to the rest of the venue.</p>

<p>Moments in this match included Mayhew wanting to fight with the rest of CPF; Munny hitting one of his opponents with the Ainsley Lariat until the rest (all ten of course!) broke up the pin; Munny and Mayhew walking on the top rope like a tightrope while clinging onto Omari and Cooper respectively—while those in the ring were fighting—and then diving onto the rest of their opponents before Omari and Vertigo had dives of their own (Cooper went for a tope suicida, but it was blocked from ringside); Krishna putting the Sunshine Machine in a double crossface while Tu Byt had one of the SM members in an ankle lock; Cooper hitting Krishna with a tope suicida and then Munny hitting him—on the chairs in the audience—with a Cactus Jack elbow drop from the apron; Bird having ¾ of CPF in holds (Lando in an Indian death lock, Black in an abdominal stretch, and Newman in an armbar) until Mayhew rained on his parade by stopping him from putting his CPF colleagues in those holds before Mayhew ended up being used as a weapon by Bird and Krishna; Omari, Mayhew and Newman hitting their opponents with shooting star presses including one at ringside; Munny hitting Black and Newman with a double James Blunt Force Trauma; and Mambo and Black with assisted dives—from Cooper and Newman respectively—to their opponents at ringside. The match ended Bird cleaning house and then hitting Vertigo with a middle rope piledriver for the win. After the match, Bird said that Mayhew and Omari deserve a shot at the Progress Tag Team Championship while he’s going after Spike Trivet for the Progress World Championship. <strong>My score: 3.75/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-8-rhio-defeated-skye-smitson-w-lana-austin-and-la-taylor">Match #8: Rhio defeated Skye Smitson (w/ Lana Austin and L.A. Taylor).</h2>
<p>Kanji was scheduled to fight in this match until it was revealed that she was absent due to illness. Before the match started, Lana said that Kanji was scared of fighting her, then performed “Lana-oke” in the ring—singing songs from “Grease” and “Frozen”—until Rhio came into the ring; Rhio said that she knew which member of the Lana Austin Experience she was going to face since Skye was the only member wearing wrestling gear. After Skye hit Rhio with the Smitson Effect for a near fall followed by a fisherman’s buster for two, Lana grabbed Rhio for Skye until Rhio dodged and made Skye knock Lana off the apron; this led to Rhio winning with a package piledriver. After the match, L.A. attacked Rhio, then Millie ran in and hit Skye with a spear until L.A. slammed her. Then, while the Lana Austin Experience was leaving, Taonga appeared and wanted to team with the three until the three had no interest in celebrating with her. <strong>My score: 2.5/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="main-event-dan-moloney-defeated-spike-trivet-w-bullit-in-a-non-title-match">Main event: Dan Moloney defeated Spike Trivet (w/ Bullit) in a non-title match.</h2>
<p>Before the match started, Trivet said that Manchester was “like Sheffield but more [f-bombed] in the head”, then said that Moloney didn’t deserve this match because of how many times he lost—especially to Trivet—and that people like Moloney work for people like him. Moloney went for the Drilla early on until Trivet got to the apron where Moloney knocked him off, and Bullit caught Trivet as if he jumped out of a burning building. Then, at ringside, Moloney had Trivet seated and—after placing a fan’s sign on his chest—chopped him off; he then had a fan hold Trivet down so he could hit his opponent with a running punt. Later on, Trivet hit Moloney with the Swan Woo dropkicks followed by a Rude Awakening, then went for a package piledriver until Moloney hit him with a Last Ride (ala the Undertaker) for two. Near the end, Bullit—behind the referee’s back—hit Moloney with a low blow and tripped him on the apron, leading to Trivet hitting his opponent with a middle rope Codebreaker for two; Moloney then pretended to be tripped by Bullit, leading to the referee and ring crew sending Trivet’s bodyguard to the back. Afterwards, Moloney won after hitting Trivet with the Drilla. Post-match, Moloney—while sitting and then standing on top of Trivet—called out Bullit who then stared at him while helping Trivet to the back. <strong>My score: 3/5</strong></p>

<h1 id="survivor-series-wargames">Survivor Series WarGames</h1>

<p>It’s now time to head to the TD Garden in Boston, Massachusetts in the United States. Cue “War Games” by Black Sabbath as well as “Parasite” by Ozzy Osbourne featuring Zakk Wylde because it’s time to take a look back at Survivor Series…(in a William Regal voice)…WAR GAMES!!!</p>

<p>(Interesting to note, “War Games” by Black Sabbath was also the official theme song of NXT TakeOver: WarGames in 2020.)</p>

<p>It was the first time that WWE’s main roster—Raw and SmackDown—held WarGames matches; one was for the women, and the other was for the men. It was also the third time in Survivor Series history that there weren’t any traditional Survivor Series matches that were part of the pay-per-view/premium live event; 1998 only focused on a tournament that was for the then-vacant WWE Championship (back when WWE was still a “Federation”), and 2002 only focused on the then-brand-new Elimination Chamber.</p>

<p>With the exception of the SmackDown Women’s Championship match that turned out to be a cakewalk for Ronda Rousey as I figured (regardless of how much hell Shotzi gave to both her and Shayna Baszler), the rest of the matches were very good. Out of the five matches that took place that night, both WarGames matches and the one-on-one bout between Finn Bálor and AJ Styles were my favorites.</p>

<p>This wasn’t the first time that Finn Bálor and AJ Styles fought in a one-on-one match. Back in October of 2017 at TLC, Bálor was scheduled to face Bray Wyatt as both “The Demon” and “Sister Abigail” respectively until Wyatt was replaced with AJ Styles because Wyatt had medical issues; both Styles and “The Demon” clashed in the ring, and it ended with Bálor winning the bout. Fast forward to November of 2022 where Styles is back together with the OC and Bálor is with the Judgment Day. To me, it was as good as their first one-on-one match from five years ago; this time, the outcome was much different as Styles would be the victor in this bout.</p>

<p>Onto the WarGames matches, they were as good as the last WarGames matches that I’ve seen back when it was only exclusive for the NXT roster; seeing both Raw and SmackDown superstars compete in this type of match this year was definitely worth the wait. Not only did we see the wrestlers that had WarGames experience in the past (Bianca Belair, Rhea Ripley, Dakota Kai, Iyo Sky, Kevin Owens and Butch) collaborate with those that had their first taste of being a WarGames participant, but also all twenty competitors giving their all inside two rings surrounded by one cage. I can assure you that Dusty Rhodes was smiling from the heavens as soon as he saw those WarGames bouts.</p>

<p>For the women, the storyline heading into this match was Damage CTRL running roughshod on Raw’s women’s roster—as well as SmackDown’s women’s roster in their select appearances—including targeting Bianca Belair for the Raw Women’s Championship after Bayley lost to her a couple times for that belt; other storylines included Mia Yim solving the OC’s “Rhea Ripley problem” as well as the return of someone Bayley attacked two days after Summer Slam. For the men, the storyline heading into this match was whether or not Sami Zayn would be trusted—in the eyes of Jey Uso—as the “honorary Uce” in the Bloodline even after seeing him encounter his best friend Kevin Owens less than 24 hours prior to this event; another storyline was the ongoing rivalry between the Bloodline and the Brawling Brutes stemming back to when the Usos and Solo Sikoa injured one of Sheamus’ arms.</p>

<p>In my honest opinion, both the women and men kicked ass in those matches from how they competed both with and without weapons to focusing on the storylines that came into play. Will next year’s WarGames matches be as good as those as well as the past WarGames matches that we’ve seen in the WWE? I sure hope so. Besides, seeing NXT’s WarGames matches as well as similar ones such as—most recently—ICW’s Super Smokin’ Thunderbowl at Barred II prior to seeing Raw and SmackDown’s WarGames matches have indeed paid off.</p>

<p>Here are the match results from Boston…</p>

<h2 id="match-1-becky-lynch-alexa-bliss-asuka-michin-mia-yim--bianca-belair-defeated-rhea-ripley-nikki-cross--damage-ctrl-in-wargames">Match #1: Becky Lynch, Alexa Bliss, Asuka, “Michin” Mia Yim &amp; Bianca Belair defeated Rhea Ripley, Nikki Cross &amp; Damage CTRL in WarGames.</h2>
<p>NXT’s Alicia Taylor was the ring announcer for this match. Bianca and Dakota Kai started off the match, followed by—in order—Iyo Sky, Asuka, Nikki (with kendo sticks, trashcan lids, handcuffs, and her own jacket), Alexa, Bayley (with two ladders and a table), Mia (with three trashcans), Rhea and finally Becky. Highlights included Nikki diving from the top of the cage and onto Bianca and Asuka who were fighting Dakota and Iyo; Bianca, Mia, Alexa and Asuka moving in stereo—ala the Cars—with superplexes to Bayley, Dakota, Nikki and Iyo respectively (Asuka’s superplex was actually a German superplex); Asuka spitting blue mist in Rhea’s face; Iyo hitting Bianca and Mia with a moonsault from the top of the cage; and Nikki attempting to handcuff Alexa to the cage until Alexa cuffed herself to the “twisted sister.” The match ended with Bianca hitting Bayley with the KOD into the steel mesh while Becky hit Dakota and Iyo with a diving leg drop from the top of the cage and through the table for the win. <strong>My score: 4/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-2-aj-styles-w-luke-gallows-and-karl-anderson-defeated-finn-bálor-w-dominik-mysterio-and-damian-priest">Match #2: AJ Styles (w/ Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson) defeated Finn Bálor (w/ Dominik Mysterio and Damian Priest).</h2>
<p>Bálor wore an all-black mask to the ring, and Styles wore a gas mask that’s part of the OC’s logo. Styles worked on Bálor’s left leg early in the match. During the bout, Priest distracted the referee which allowed Mysterio to trip Styles on the apron; this led to Gallows and Anderson fighting the Judgment Day members at ringside and into the crowd, with Styles throwing Mysterio into the crowd as the managers fought away from the ringside area. Both Styles and Bálor traded signature maneuvers as well as stole signature maneuvers later on; Bálor was unable to hit the Styles Clash (which was countered with a Calf Crusher attempt) but was able to hit Styles with an ushigoroshi (one of Styles’ signatures), and Styles hit him with a moonsault into a neckbreaker/elbow drop combo (one of Bálor’s signatures). After Bálor got out of the Calf Crusher by bouncing Styles’ head off the mat like a basketball, Styles came back and won with the Phenomenal Forearm. <strong>My score: 4/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-3-ronda-rousey-w-shayna-baszler-defeated-shotzi-to-retain-the-smackdown-womens-championship">Match #3: Ronda Rousey (w/ Shayna Baszler) defeated Shotzi to retain the SmackDown Women’s Championship.</h2>
<p>Shotzi wore KISS-inspired gear. During the match, Shotzi—after hitting Ronda with a botched tornado DDT on the apron—bounced off of her opponent and hit Shayna with Sliced Bread, then threw the two into the audience and hit them with a crossbody from the barricade, causing them to collapse into three fans seated at ringside. Ronda came back and hit Shotzi with Piper’s Pit before making her submit to an armbar. <strong>My score: 2/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-4-austin-theory-defeated-bobby-lashley-and-seth-freakin-rollins-to-become-the-new-wwe-united-states-champion">Match #4: Austin Theory defeated Bobby Lashley and Seth “Freakin’” Rollins to become the new WWE United States Champion.</h2>
<p>Even though Theory’s theme song was still playing, his entrance video was replaced with an advertisement for Beyblade Burst QuadDrive for some reason. As soon as the bell rang, Lashley clotheslined Theory out of the ring, as did Rollins ten seconds or so later. Lashley fought Theory at the timekeeper’s area until Rollins hit him with a flying knee from the apron before Theory fought back and attacked the two with steel stairs. Later on, Rollins hit Lashley with a tope suicida, Theory with the same maneuver, and Lashley with it again before throwing Theory into the same area as Lashley and hitting the two with a tope con giro. Towards the end, Theory attempted to hit Rollins with a Pedigree (one of Rollins’ signatures), and Rollins attempted to hit Theory with the A-Town Down (Theory’s finisher) until Lashley put the two in a double Hurt Lock; Rollins fought out of the hold and took down the two, then used Theory as a springboard and stomped Lashley. Then, after Lashley was sent into a corner (and ended up with some cuts on his face afterwards), Rollins hit Theory with a superplex and went for a Falcon Arrow until Lashley hit him with a spear on the way down, leading to Theory pinning Rollins for the win. <strong>My score: 3.75/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="main-event-the-bloodline-w-paul-heyman-defeated-kevin-owens-drew-mcintyre--the-brawling-brutes-in-wargames">Main event: The Bloodline (w/ Paul Heyman) defeated Kevin Owens, Drew McIntyre &amp; the Brawling Brutes in WarGames.</h2>
<p>Heyman had a boot on his left leg as he came with the Bloodline. Butch and Jey Uso started off the match, followed by—in order—Ridge Holland, Sami Zayn (after Roman Reigns told Jimmy Uso to wait), McIntyre, Jimmy Uso (with three tables), Owens (with steel chairs), Solo Sikoa, Sheamus and finally Roman Reigns. Highlights from this match included Butch working on Jey’s right hand; Zayn and Jey arguing (even with Jimmy intervening at one point); and Owens, McIntyre and the Brawling Brutes giving all five of their opponents more than 50 “Beats of the Bodhran.” Near the end, Zayn stopped the referee from performing the three count while Owens pinned Reigns, then Jimmy attempted to hit Owens with a superkick until Owens blocked it before Zayn—who had Reigns watch—hit him with a low blow followed by the Helluva Kick; then, Jimmy hit Owens with a top rope splash for the win. After the match, Reigns and Zayn hugged, then the hatchet was buried as Jey gave Zayn a hug before all five members of the Bloodline celebrated together. <strong>My score: 4/5</strong></p>

<h1 id="icw-fight-club">ICW Fight Club</h1>

<p>Returning to the United Kingdom, we head to the Northumbria University Students Union in Newcastle Upon Tyne, England for an episode of ICW Fight Club.</p>

<p>Four matches, that were buildups to Fear &amp; Loathing XIV, took place on this week’s episode. Out of the four matches that took place, my favorite would go to the opening bout between Leyton Buzzard and Ian Skinner. Like is tag team partner Charlie Vyce in last week’s episode, Skinner also had a strong showing as a singles competitor—and, like Vyce, he’s no stranger to fighting in singles action—this week. Plus, like Craig Anthony when he took on the aforementioned Vyce on last week’s episode, Buzzard also had a good warmup heading into F&amp;L in his bout. Seeing both Buzzard and Anthony pick up wins was a great way to build their momentums heading into that event, and this match was indeed a good way to kick off this week’s episode besides a great back-and-forth bout.</p>

<p>Here are the match results from Newcastle Upon Tyne…</p>

<h2 id="match-1-leyton-buzzard-defeated-ian-skinner-w-charlie-vyce">Match #1: Leyton Buzzard defeated Ian Skinner (w/ Charlie Vyce).</h2>
<p>Skinner made a Lykos Gym mistake during the match as he shouted out “Brainbuster!” before Buzzard countered the brainbuster with a suplex for two. Near the end, Skinner gave Buzzard joint manipulation until Buzzard came back with a superkick and the Buzzkiller before putting him in a Scorpion Death Lock; Skinner grabbed the bottom rope for the break until Buzzard hit him with a second Buzzkiller followed by the X Marks the Spot for the win. <strong>My score: 3.75/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-2-thatcher-wright-defeated-levi-if-wright-won-he-would-be-inserted-into-the-ladder-matchfor-a-future-shot-at-the-icw-zero-g-championshipat-fear--loathing-xiv">Match #2: Thatcher Wright defeated Levi; if Wright won, he would be inserted into the ladder match—for a future shot at the ICW Zero-G Championship—at Fear &amp; Loathing XIV.</h2>
<p>Before the match started, Wright wanted the fans to thank Margaret Thatcher for what she did for their hometown; the fans booed and chanted “[F-bomb] the Tories” instead. He then blindsided his opponent seconds before the bell rang. During the match, Wright was reading from his Margaret Thatcher book while kicking and stomping Levi down until Levi—after Thatcher handed the book to the referee—fought back. Towards the end, Charlie Vyce and Ian Skinner appeared, and Skinner slid the book to Thatcher who then struck Levi with it before pinning him for the win. <strong>My score: 1.5/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-3-kasey-defeated-martin-macalistair-in-almost-three-minutes">Match #3: Kasey defeated Martin MacAlistair in almost three minutes.</h2>
<p>Kasey was originally scheduled to compete against Lizzy Evo, but she was absent; Kasey mocked her for not being in attendance, then challenged anyone—including the medic and merchandise seller—to fight her. MacAlistair—who was 0-26 heading into the match according to Simon Cassidy (thus making it feel like I’m watching AEW with the win-loss record being mentioned)—answered the challenge, and Kasey fought him; he was afraid to hit her during the match, and this gave Kasey the upper hand from start to finish as well as win with Off With Her Head. Afterwards, Kasey sent a message to Molly Spartan by taking off the She Wolves t-shirt and stomping it in the middle of the ring. <strong>No score.</strong></p>

<h2 id="main-event-jack-jester-defeated-rory-coyle-in-an-insane-rules-match">Main event: Jack Jester defeated Rory Coyle in an Insane Rules match.</h2>
<p>Coyle came with a bag of weapons as well as a video camera; inside the bag were a kendo stick, two sets of jumper cables, videotapes and a VCR. Both Coyle and Jester took turns using the camera while fighting including having a fan hold the camera for the two, and Jester taking a page out of Logan Paul’s playbook by fighting and filming at the same time. After Jester hit Coyle with the VCR and then slammed him onto the tapes, he struck Coyle with an exploding cassette—with red dust flying everywhere—for the win. After the match, BT Gunn appeared and Jester dared him to get in the ring. Gunn came in, but then got out after it looked like the two were getting ready to fight. Then, Sha Samuels came and threw Gunn back in the ring, and then he and Jester fought Gunn out of the ring before celebrating. <strong>My score: 2.5/5</strong></p>

<h1 id="nxt">NXT</h1>

<p>Returning to the United States, we head to Orlando, Florida for an episode of NXT.</p>

<p>The male and female participants for the two Iron Survivor Challenge matches at NXT Deadline were made this week, courtesy of a panel consisting of WWE Hall of Famers Shawn Michaels, Road Dogg, Sean Waltman, Alundra Blayze and Molly Holly; four were announced for the men’s match, and four were announced for the women’s match.</p>

<p>The four male wrestlers for their Iron Survivor Challenge match will be Carmelo Hayes, JD McDonagh, Grayson Waller and Joe Gacy, and the fifth competitor will be the winner of a wildcard triple threat match (taking place next week); the three attempting to qualify for this match are Von Wagner, Axiom and Andre Chase.</p>

<p>As for the women’s Iron Survivor Challenge match, the four female wrestlers will be Zoey Stark, Cora Jade, Roxanne Perez, Kiana James and—like the men’s match—the winner of a wildcard triple threat match (also taking place next week); the three attempting to qualify for this match are Wendy Choo, Fallon Henley and Indi Hartwell.
I don’t have any predictions for either Iron Survivor Challenge match yet, but I do like the choices that were made for those two bouts. I’m glad to see Hayes, McDonagh, Waller and Gacy in this match mainly because of how much they accomplished especially during the short-lived multicolored “2.0” era—especially Hayes who won gold on NXT, ditto McDonagh during his time on NXT UK—and I believe that we’ll see Axiom qualify for this match next week.</p>

<p>As for the women, I agree with who was selected to be in this match, especially Kiana who appears to be getting a push as of late even before her rivalry with Fallon Henley. Speaking of Fallon, I’m torn on seeing either her or Indi qualifying for that match next week; part of me would like to see the Kiana/Fallon rivalry take part of the Iron Survivor Challenge at Deadline, but the other part of me sees Indi getting a push while focusing on her character where she’s proving the new additions to the women’s roster—the hard way—what she’s capable of.</p>

<p>Eight matches took place this week, and there were three matches that I enjoyed. One was the opening match between Roxanne Perez and Indi Hartwell; both women had a strong showing in this match and proving that they deserve to be making names for themselves in Deadline, even though we didn’t see Indi take part of the qualifying match yet per se.</p>

<p>Another match that I liked was between Javier Bernal and Axiom. Axiom has been on a roll ever since he jumped to NXT before his tenure as A-Kid came to a close, and Bernal also had a good showing not just in competition but also on building his cocky heel character.</p>

<p>Lastly, I also enjoyed the match between JD McDonagh and Julius Creed. It was another good bout that McDonagh competed in, even with his sinister heel character coming into play; the same goes for Julius who continues to have a good showing in singles competition and has proved it even before his ambulance match with Damon Kemp at Halloween Havoc occurred.
Here are the NXT results from Orlando…</p>

<h2 id="match-1-roxanne-perez-defeated-indi-hartwell">Match #1: Roxanne Perez defeated Indi Hartwell.</h2>
<p>As soon as the match began, Roxanne offered a handshake until Indi slapped her hand away. After Indi booted Roxanne down, Roxanne kicked her away and then—after clubbing her in the back to help herself jump over her opponent—won with the Pop Rox. My score: 3.5/5</p>

<h2 id="match-2-dijak-defeated-dante-chen-in-almost-four-minutes">Match #2: Dijak defeated Dante Chen in almost four minutes.</h2>
<p>Chen had a bloody mouth during the match. Dijak wore down Chen with a sleeper, then won with the Feast Your Eyes. After the match, Dijak said that what he did was “an example of hard justice”, then vowed to eviscerate anyone that gets in his way—calling out Wes Lee, Chen, Apollo Crews and Bron Breakker—and bring them to his “justice.” My score: 1/5
Match #3: Grayson Waller defeated Duke Hudson (w/ Andre Chase and Thea Hail). Earlier, both Waller and Hudson were grabbing each other by the hair until Chase told Hudson to stop cheating. Near the end, Hudson attempted to boot Waller, but missed and almost hit Thea; after Hudson calmed Thea down, he came back in the ring where Waller won with a through-the-ropes cutter. <strong>My score: 1/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-4-kiana-james-defeated-fallon-henley-w-josh-briggs-and-brooks-jensen">Match #4: Kiana James defeated Fallon Henley (w/ Josh Briggs and Brooks Jensen).</h2>
<p>Fallon’s left arm was worked on. After Fallon fought back, she chased Kiana until Kiana threw her purse at her before sending her shoulder first into a corner and winning with the 401k. <strong>My score: 2.5/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-5-axiom-defeated-javier-bernal">Match #5: Axiom defeated Javier Bernal.</h2>
<p>This match was made after Bernal was announcing who he wanted to fight, even with a long list of enemies that also included Elon Musk. Axiom wore a green and gold outfit that was a tribute to Jason David Frank, an actor best known as Tommy in the “Power Rangers” franchise whom we lost recently. Axiom’s right leg was worked on. After Bernal dodged the Golden Ratio and hit Axiom with a DDT for two, he climbed to the top rope until Axiom hit him with a superplex and the Golden Ratio for the win. <strong>My score: 3.5/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-6-julius-creed-w-brutus-creed-defeated-jd-mcdonagh-by-disqualification">Match #6: Julius Creed (w/ Brutus Creed) defeated JD McDonagh by disqualification.</h2>
<p>Indus Sher appeared during the match. After McDonagh hit Julius with an Asai moonsault, he attempted to work on one of his legs (like he has to Axiom) until Julius powered him away; McDonagh then grabbed a steel chair and attempted to hit Julius with it until Sanga shoved Julius out of the way—giving Julius the DQ win—and took the bullet. After the match, Veer Mahaan and Sanga approached the Creed Brothers (as well as Ivy Nile who checked on Julius). <strong>My score: 3.5/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-7-von-wagner-w-mr-stone-defeated-malik-blade-in-almost-three-minutes">Match #7: Von Wagner (w/ Mr. Stone) defeated Malik Blade in almost three minutes.</h2>
<p>This match was made after Wagner refused to hang out with Blade and Edris Enofé and attacked them, and then tore what was the last sweater vest Blade’s father wore before his passing. After Blade—who brought that torn sweater vest to the ring—surprised Wagner with a bodyslam, he went for a frog splash, but it was blocked; this led to Wagner winning with a Death Valley Bomb. Afterwards, Enofé ran in to stop Wagner from continuing to attack Blade; Enofé was beaten down by Wagner until Odyssey Jones ran in and fought him out of the ring. <strong>My score: 1/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="main-event-toxic-attraction-defeated-nikkita-lyons-kayden-carter--katana-chance">Main event: Toxic Attraction defeated Nikkita Lyons, Kayden Carter &amp; Katana Chance.</h2>
<p>This was supposed to be the fifth match of the episode until Zoey Stark attacked Nikkita at the entryway; Nikkita ended up competing with a bandaged right knee afterwards. Towards the end, Nikkita hit Jacy Jayne with a leg split leg drop until Gigi Dolin broke up the pin. Then, Mandy Rose—who hit Katana with the Kiss By the Rose at ringside—distracted Nikkita from the apron, and Nikkita attempted to kick her off but collapsed due to the injured knee; this allowed Gigi and Jacy to win with a leg sweep/heel kick combo. After the match, Zoey appeared on the stage and taunted Nikkita. <strong>My score: 2/5</strong></p>

<h1 id="nxt-lvl-up">NXT: LVL UP</h1>

<p>Staying in Orlando, we wrap things up with an episode of NXT: LVL UP.</p>

<p>Both the opener and closer were my favorite matches of this episode. The opener was Oro Mensah taking on Myles Borne, and the two gave us a great way to kick off this week’s episode; Borne is still giving his opponents a good run for their money (as well as looking for his next win), and Mensah continues to give his opponents a strong showing just like he did on NXT UK as well as his select NXT appearances when he was renamed from “Oliver Carter” to “Oro Mensah.”</p>

<p>The closer was Thea Hail taking on Sol Ruca, and those two wrestlers definitely gave us a good way to end this episode on a high note; Sol continues to be impressive in her fighting ability even while attempting to close in on another win, and the same goes for Thea even with her own high-octane energy coming into play.</p>

<p>Here are the NXT: LVL UP results from Orlando…</p>

<h2 id="match-1-oro-mensah-defeated-myles-borne">Match #1: Oro Mensah defeated Myles Borne.</h2>
<p>After Borne picked up a two after a sleeper into a northern lights suplex, Mensah came back and won with a running heel kick. Both men hugged afterwards. <strong>My score: 3/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-2-stacks-w-tony-dangelo-defeated-tavion-heights-in-four-minutes">Match #2: Stacks (w/ Tony D’Angelo) defeated Tavion Heights in four minutes.</h2>
<p>This was Heights’ debut. Stacks won with a Curbstomp-like knee drop. <strong>My score: 1.5/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="main-event-thea-hail-w-andre-chase-and-duke-hudson-defeated-sol-ruca">Main event: Thea Hail (w/ Andre Chase and Duke Hudson) defeated Sol Ruca.</h2>
<p>After Thea fought out of Sol’s surfboard and fought back including hitting her with a senton for two, Sol went for a rollup until Thea countered with a rollup of her own for the win. Post-match, Chase U showed respect to Sol. <strong>My score: 3/5</strong></p>

<h1 id="progress-chapter-144-the-deadly-viper-tour--codename-snake-charmer">Progress Chapter 144: The Deadly Viper Tour – Codename: Snake Charmer</h1>

<p>Let’s kick things off with a belated Progress recap!</p>

<p>The 144th chapter of Progress took place at the Tramshed in Cardiff, Wales in the United Kingdom; it also served as the tail end of the Deadly Viper Tour. Hosting the event was Session Moth Martina who took over for Simon Miller that day, and she did very well doing the ring announcing duties as well as have fun, drinking games and all.</p>

<p>Eight matches were on the card for this chapter, including three championship matches; one of the championship bouts that took place involved tables.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/2022-12-27/deadly_viper_cardiff.jpg" class="restrict-width">progress cardiff</a></p>

<p>There were two matches that were my favorites on that chapter. One was the Progress Women’s Championship match between Kanji and Millie McKenzie. Millie came into this match with a win streak being built ever since she returned to Progress a couple chapters ago. Kanji entered the match showing and proving what it took to be a fighting champion. Both women were definitely impressive in this bout, and in the end, it was Kanji who would retain the belt.</p>

<p>The other match that was also my favorite was the reunited FSU—Mark Andrews and Eddie Dennis—taking on the team of Man Like Dereiss and Omari. Bear with me since I’m almost two years into watching Progress…this was the first time I’ve seen FSU in action (not counting footage of the teamwork done by Andrews and Dennis), and it was amazing. It was great back and forth action between two teams, one that was reunited and another that consisted of two wrestlers that teamed together for the first time. In the end, it was FSU who was victorious.</p>

<p>Here are the match results from Cardiff…</p>

<h2 id="match-1-lykos-gym-defeated-kidd-bandit--warhorse">Match #1: Lykos Gym defeated Kidd Bandit &amp; Warhorse.</h2>
<p>This was the debut of KB &amp; Warhorse. Warhorse had Kid Lykos in a Scorpion Death Lock, and was able to hit a charging Kid Lykos II with a back body drop until KL raked his eyes to get out of the hold; KB tagged in and they hit KL with a corkscrew splash for two while their partner Warhorse hit KL2 with a tope suicida, then—behind the referee’s back—KL2 hit KB with a baking tray and nailed a middle rope Spanish Fly, then KL hit them with the Casanova kick for the win. <strong>My score: 2.25/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-2-raven-creed-defeated-taonga">Match #2: Raven Creed defeated Taonga.</h2>
<p>After Taonga blocked the Hellmouth and Raven blocked the I’m Prettier, Taonga hit Raven with a reverse DDT for two, then Raven lifted her up and—despite being elbowed by Taonga—hit her with the Hellmouth for the win. <strong>My score: 3/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-3-lana-austin--la-taylor-defeated-rho--jetta">Match #3: Lana Austin &amp; L.A. Taylor defeated Rho &amp; Jetta.</h2>
<p>Lana sang “Let It Go” from the movie “Frozen” before the match. The team of Lana and L.A. won after L.A. hit Jetta with a Sky High (ala D’Lo Brown) and Lana picked up the scraps by tagging in and pinning her for the win. <strong>My score: 1.5/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-4-kanji-defeated-millie-mckenzie-to-retain-the-progress-womens-championship">Match #4: Kanji defeated Millie McKenzie to retain the Progress Women’s Championship.</h2>
<p>Millie surprised Kanji with rollups for two counts in the beginning. After Millie missed on a spear attempt and crashed out of the ring, Kanji hit her—and a couple crewmen—with a crossbody from the apron; as soon as the action returned to the ring, Millie threw Kanji off the top rope and hit her with a spear for a near fall. Kanji put Millie in a full nelson and then transitioned it into a triangle choke until Millie pinned her for two and hit her with a second spear before Kanji put her foot on the bottom rope. The two then went back and forth with strikes and pin attempts, even with exhaustion coming into play, until Kanji won with a discus elbow.</p>

<p>Both wrestlers hugged afterwards util Lana and L.A. ran in and attacked the two; Rhio ran in until Taonga evened the odds before Raven Creen ran in. Taonga and Lana were fought out of the ring, and Millie hit L.A. with a spear, then Kanji said that she, Rhio, Millie and Raven had enough of the Lana Austin Experience’s bullshit and challenged them to a four-on-four tag match for the next chapter. (Later on, Raven backed out of the match due to having bad luck with the LAE.) <strong>My score: 4.75/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-5-fsu-defeated-man-like-dereiss--omari">Match #5: FSU defeated Man Like Dereiss &amp; Omari.</h2>
<p>This was the first time that FSU competed together since 2019, and it was Mark Andrews’ first Progress match since February 2020. Omari hit Eddie Dennis with a double underhook DDT until Andrews broke up the pin with the Fall To Pieces (shooting star press), then Dennis pinned Omari until Dereiss broke it up with the Four Fiddy; then, Dennis went for the Gunslinger until Omari rolled him up for two and then hit him with a leg lariat and gut wrench powerbomb for another two. Dereiss tagged in and he and Omari hit Dennis with a 3D until Andrews broke up the pin, then Dereiss attempted to hit Dennis with the Four Fiddy, but missed; FSU then hit Dereiss with a Severed Bridge/jumping heel kick combo followed by a Neckstop Driver/double stomp combo for the win. Both teams showed respect to each other afterwards. <strong>My score: 4.75/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-6-nico-angelo-defeated-joe-lando-in-the-quarterfinal-round-of-the-natural-progression-series-tournament">Match #6: Nico Angelo defeated Joe Lando in the quarterfinal round of the Natural Progression Series tournament.</h2>
<p>Tate Mayfairs joined Olie Spring and SoCal Val on commentary; he was scheduled to compete against Tom Dawkins, but Dawkins was absent. Angelo forearmed away a tope attempt from Lando until Lando knocked him off the apron and was able to hit him with the tope suicida. The end of the match saw Lando hit Angelo with the Matrix Cutter followed by an Olympic Slam into a brainbuster for a near fall (P.S.: Happy birthday Kurt Angle!), and then Angelo blocked a shooting star press before pinning Lando for the win. After the match, Mayfairs confronted Angelo who almost struck him. <strong>My score: 4/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-7-the-sunshine-machine-defeated-the-greedy-souls-in-a-tag-team-tables-elimination-match-to-retain-the-progress-tag-team-championship">Match #7: The Sunshine Machine defeated the Greedy Souls in a tag team tables elimination match to retain the Progress Tag Team Championship.</h2>
<p>TK Cooper was unable to powerbomb Brendan White off the apron and through the table, even with Chuck Mambo’s help; a minute or so later, Mambo was shoved off the apron by White and put through the table, eliminating him. Later on, Danny Jones catapulted Cooper into White who went for a Black Hole Slam until Cooper countered it with a Canadian Destroyer through the table, eliminating White; both Mambo and White were still fighting despite being eliminated. After Mambo hit Jones with a reverse piledriver on the apron and then he and Cooper fought away a chair equipped White on the stage at the entryway, Mambo hit Jones with an assisted splash—from Cooper—from the stage and through the table for the win. Both teams bumped fists afterwards until Lykos Gym ran in and attacked both teams, using both the belts and baking trays as weapons; the two then brandished a pair of scissors and cut one of Mambo’s braids off, then ran to the stage and celebrated with the braid as if it were the FIFA World Cup trophy. <strong>My score: 3/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="main-event-spike-trivet-w-bullit-defeated-mike-bird-to-retain-the-progress-world-championship">Main event: Spike Trivet (w/ Bullit) defeated Mike Bird to retain the Progress World Championship.</h2>
<p>Before the match started, Bullit had Session Moth Martina announce Trivet as “The Prince of Wales.” During the match, Bird blocked the Birthright and he and Trivet exchanged suplexes; Trivet had Saito suplexes, and Bird had German suplexes. Bird knocked Bullit off the apron before, when the referee wasn’t looking, Trivet hit him with a low blow and the Birthright for a near fall; Trivet then hit him with a Swan Woo until the second Swan Woo knocked out the referee. Trivet hit Bird with another low blow and went for a package piledriver until Bird countered with a LeBell Lock until Bullit broke up the hold and hit him with a chokeslam; Trivet pinned Bird for two, and then put him in the Ascot which Bird powered out of until Trivet hit him with a package piledriver for a near fall and then incapacitated him with the Ascot for the win. After the match, Trivet and Bird attempted to attack Bird some more until Dan Moloney ran in and chased the two out of the ring, and stood on Trivet’s belt before the champion and bodyguard left; then, Moloney stayed in the ring and showed respect to Bird. <strong>My score: 3.75/5</strong></p>

<h1 id="icw-fight-club">ICW Fight Club</h1>

<p>Staying in United Kingdom, we’re heading to the Northumbria University Students Union in Newcastle Upon Tyne, England for an episode of ICW Fight Club.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/2022-12-27/icw_fight_club.jpg" class="restrict-width">icw fight club</a></p>

<p>Four matches took place this week on Fight Club, and my favorite match of the episode was another match that was a warmup prior to Fear &amp; Loathing XIV; it involved Stevie James and Craig Anthony who—along with Leyton Buzzard—were scheduled to fight Kez Evans for the ICW World Heavyweight Championship at that event. The warmup matches prior to that championship bout have been amazing so far, and this includes this match between James and Anthony. Those two fought tooth and nail as if they were already fighting for gold prior to F&amp;L, and in the end, it was “The Natural” Anthony who was the winner of this bout. Seeing those warmup matches that featured those two wrestlers, as well as Buzzard and Evans, definitely showed that those four were ready for F&amp;L.</p>

<p>Here are the match results from Newcastle Upon Tyne…</p>

<h2 id="match-1-saqib-ali--andy-wild-defeated-coach-trip--jason-reed">Match #1: Saqib Ali &amp; Andy Wild defeated Coach Trip &amp; Jason Reed.</h2>
<p>Ali and Wild had a DX tribute before the match, with Ali posing like Shawn Michaels and Wild posing like Triple H. Almost one minute after the match began, it looked like that Reed and Wild would go at it until Reed decided to tag in his coach. Ali countered the Club Deck with a stunner before tagging in Wild who cleaned house and then hit his opponents with the Strowman Express at ringside. Then, Reed threw a chair to Trip who used it to block Wild’s Dad Bomb before Wild recovered and chased Reed out of the ring with the chair; Wild then hit Trip with the chair before Ali won with a Claymore. <strong>My score: 2/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-2-craig-anthony-defeated-the-outlaw-stevie-james">Match #2: Craig Anthony defeated “The Outlaw” Stevie James.</h2>
<p>Both wrestlers fought at ringside earlier where James hit Anthony with a Death Valley Driver on the apron and then hit him with a tope suicida. Towards the end, Anthony hit James with a back superplex, and then went for a snap moonsault until James countered with a superkick for two; Anthony came back with a roundhouse kick before winning with a pumphandle driver. After the match, James said that Anthony winning won’t happen again at Fear &amp; Loathing XIV, vowing to win the ICW World Heavyweight Championship before he and Anthony shook hands. <strong>My score: 3.75/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-3-glasgow-grindhouse-defeated-grant-mcivor--eddie-castle-w-adm-to-retain-the-icw-tag-team-championship">Match #3: Glasgow Grindhouse defeated Grant McIvor &amp; Eddie Castle (w/ ADM) to retain the ICW Tag Team Championship.</h2>
<p>This match was made after Lou King Sharp and Krieger saved Sha Samuels from K.O.E who attacked him during an episode of “The Polo Lounge” with “Jackie Polo” and Denise. Plus, this match was scheduled to be a non-title match until Glasgow Grindhouse decided to prove to be fighting champions prior to Fear &amp; Loathing XIV. Near the end, Dylan Thorn attacked ADM at the entryway, and it got the attention of McIvor and Castle until Krieger threw Sharp out of the ring and into the two. Glasgow Grindhouse then won after hitting McIvor with the Director’s Cut (wheelbarrow slam/middle rope bulldog combo). After the match, Moxie Malone came into the ring with a chain until McIvor and Castle attacked the distracted champions; then, Angel Hayze appeared and told Moxie to pay attention to her and not her “backup plan” in the form of Sharp and Krieger who fought McIvor and Castle to the back. <strong>My score: 2.5/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="main-event-moxie-malone-defeated-angel-hayze-in-a-newcastle-street-fight">Main event: Moxie Malone defeated Angel Hayze in a Newcastle Street Fight.</h2>
<p>Both wrestlers fought into the crowd and into the student lounge during the match where Moxie threw a fan’s drink at Angel, Angel fought with a trashcan, and both fought with a beanbag. As soon as the two left the lounge, there was a moment straight out of MTV’s “Jackass” as Angel put Moxie in a shopping cart and spun her into the wall before Moxie blinded her with some hand sanitizer. As soon as both Moxie and Angel brought the action back into the ring, ADM fought Dylan Thorn to the ringside area, and then tripped Angel which allowed Moxie to hit her with a neckbreaker for two; ADM then went after Angel until Thorn fought him before Moxie hit him with a chair. Then, ADM hit Angel with a chokeslam backbreaker, and Moxie incapacitated her opponent with a sleeper/bodyscissors combo for the win. After the match, Moxie threw Thorn back in the ring where ADM hit him with a chokeslam backbreaker and vowed to take away his career at Fear &amp; Loathing XIV. <strong>My score: 3/5</strong></p>

<h1 id="nxt">NXT</h1>

<p>We now head to Orlando, Florida in the United States for an episode of NXT.</p>

<p>Two more matches were made for Deadline; unfortunately, the Creed Brothers vs. Indus Sher wasn’t one of them because Julius Creed wasn’t cleared to compete. Perhaps we’ll see them clash next week or the following on NXT?</p>

<p>Onto the matches that WILL take place at Deadline…one will be a one-on-one match between Alba Fyre and Isla Dawn; this was made after Isla appeared and cost Alba the NXT Women’s Championship that Mandy Rose retained not too long ago.</p>

<p>The other will be for the NXT Tag Team Championship. This week, Pretty Deadly hosted a segment known as “A Real Christmas Story” which was their own rendition of “The Night Before Christmas” talking about not having any more teams going after them for the belts. As soon as they wrapped up their story, another team approached the two in the form of SmackDown’s Xavier Woods and Kofi Kingston, the New Day. Woods and Kingston told Elton Prince and Kit Wilson that the New Day was one of the teams that didn’t lose to the NXT Tag Team Champions yet, and this led to a brawl where we saw Prince thrown into a Christmas tree, and of course both him and Wilson being hit by gift boxes.</p>

<p>Not only does this bring a Worlds Collide feel to Deadline, but this is definitely a good challenge for the rising tag team that continues to reign NXT’s tag team division courtesy of a team from WWE’s main roster.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/2022-12-27/nxt_2.0.jpg" class="restrict-width">nxt</a></p>

<p>Overshadowing a slew of short matches were the opener and closer that served as qualifying matches, in forms of triple threat matches, to determine who would participate in the Iron Survivor Challenge matches at Deadline. On the women’s side, we saw Indi Hartwell, Wendy Choo and Fallon Henley go at it for the spot. Even though it looked like the three rushed through a good amount of the match prior to “The Grayson Waller Show” (with Waller’s ISC opponents as his guests) that served as the conclusion of this episode, but I still thought it was a good closing bout.</p>

<p>As for the men’s qualifying match that kicked off this week’s episode, it was my favorite match of the night; in this match were Von Wagner, Axiom and Andre Chase. Last week, I predicted that Axiom would qualify for the Iron Survivor Challenge match mainly because Wagner has already fought Breakker (and I doubted that we would see an ongoing rivalry between Breakker and Wagner anytime soon) and Chase U has been having bad luck as of late as we’ve seen lately. That prediction came true this week as Axiom was able to not let the size advantage from Wagner throw him off track as well as what Chase had in store for the two.</p>

<p>Here are the NXT results from Orlando…</p>

<h2 id="match-1-axiom-defeated-von-wagner-w-mr-stone-and-andre-chase-w-duke-hudson-and-thea-hail-in-a-triple-threat-match-to-qualify-for-the-iron-survivor-challenge">Match #1: Axiom defeated Von Wagner (w/ Mr. Stone) and Andre Chase (w/ Duke Hudson and Thea Hail) in a triple threat match to qualify for the Iron Survivor Challenge.</h2>
<p>Backstage before the match, Hudson and Thea said that they had Chase’s back, and Chase vowed to give his opponents a “Chase University sized ass whooping.” Near the end, Wagner went for a Death Valley Bomb, but Axiom countered with a sleeper/bodyscissors combo and then put him in a triangle choke; Wagner powered out of the hold and hit him with a powerbomb onto Chase. Wagner then hit Axiom with the Death Valley Bomb, and then Chase hit Wagner and Axiom with—respectively—a DDT/reverse DDT combo, then hit Wagner with a top rope crossbody; then, Chase rolled out of the ring which allowed Axiom to hit Wagner with the Golden Ratio. <strong>My score: 3.75/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-2-bryson-montana-vs-javier-bernal-never-took-place-at-all">Match #2: Bryson Montana vs. Javier Bernal never took place at all.</h2>
<p>Indus Sher ran in and attacked Montana, then Bernal was heading to the ring until he pretended to have a leg injury and left. Then, Veer Mahaan and Sanga declined the Creed Brothers’ challenge to a match at Deadline after hearing about their injury, then hope that they don’t wait too long. Brutus and Julius appeared with referees, Ivy Nile and Tatum Paxley pushing them away from the ring. <strong>No score.</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-3-tony-dangelo-w-stacks-defeated-xyon-quinn-in-almost-two-minutes">Match #3: Tony D’Angelo (w/ Stacks) defeated Xyon Quinn in almost two minutes.</h2>
<p>This was D’Angelo’s first match back after suffering a leg injury; he won with a blue thunder bomb to Quinn. After the match, D’Angelo blamed Wes Lee for injuring his leg, then Lee appeared and said that he has unfinished business with Dijak and then told D’Angelo to wait until D’Angelo told him to face him instead of Dijak now. Then, Dijak appeared on the screen and called D’Angelo a scumbag, then told Lee to keep his name out of his mouth; after Dijak’s appearance, Stacks said that Lee had nowhere to run and shoved him until Lee fought back and left. <strong>My score: 0.5/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-4-charlie-dempsey-defeated-hank-walker-in-four-minutes">Match #4: Charlie Dempsey defeated Hank Walker in four minutes.</h2>
<p>Drew Gulak appeared at the entryway during the match. Dempsey won after making Walker submit to a half crab/crossface combo. <strong>My score: 1/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-5-isla-dawn-defeated-thea-hail-w-andre-chase-and-duke-hudson-in-almost-three-minutes">Match #5: Isla Dawn defeated Thea Hail (w/ Andre Chase and Duke Hudson) in almost three minutes.</h2>
<p>Isla has a new theme song that sounds like a symphonic metal version of her NXT UK theme with a choir. She made this match one sided and won with two elbow drop neckbreakers. After the match, smoke emerged from one side of the ring and Alba Fyre emerged and fought Isla; referees came to separate the two, and Isla attempted to spit black mist at Alba, but missed and sprayed the referee with it. <strong>My score: 0.5/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-6-josh-briggs--brooks-jensen-defeated-malik-blade--edris-enofé-w-odyssey-jones-in-three-minutes">Match #6: Josh Briggs &amp; Brooks Jensen defeated Malik Blade &amp; Edris Enofé (w/ Odyssey Jones) in three minutes.</h2>
<p>Kiana James’ assistant placed an envelope in Jensen’s jacket early in the match. Towards the end, Von Wagner appeared and he and Odyssey Jones brawled at ringside; this allowed Jensen to hit Enofé with a running heel kick before he and Briggs hit him with a chop block/clothesline combo for the win. Both teams bumped fists afterwards. Then, it was revealed that the envelope contained a VIP invite to Deadline by Kiana, which ticked off Fallon Henley. <strong>My score: 0.5/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="main-event-indi-hartwell-defeated-wendy-choo-and-fallon-henley-in-a-triple-threat-match-to-qualify-for-the-iron-survivor-challenge">Main event: Indi Hartwell defeated Wendy Choo and Fallon Henley in a triple threat match to qualify for the Iron Survivor Challenge.</h2>
<p>Toxic Attraction watched the match backstage. Indi attempted to hit Fallon with a superplex until Wendy surprised the two with a bottom rope German suplex; Wendy then hit Fallon with a brainbuster for two, and then hit her with a reverse splash until Indi threw Wendy out of the ring to pick up the scraps by hitting Fallon with a blindsiding forearm for the win. <strong>My score: 3.5/5</strong></p>

<h1 id="nxt-lvl-up">NXT: LVL UP</h1>

<p>Staying in Orlando, we wrap things up with an episode of NXT: LVL UP.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/2022-12-27/nxt_lvl_up.jpg" class="restrict-width">nxt_lvl_up</a></p>

<p>My favorite match of this episode would have to go to the main event bout between Ikemen Jiro and Trick Williams. Williams continues to be impressive when it comes to working in singles competition. The same goes for Jiro who had a strong showing in this match. In the end, it was Williams who emerged victorious. This is no lie, but I still love seeing Williams in singles competition especially on NXT: LVL UP; I would still love to see him get one-on-one matches on NXT as well and not just LVL UP to be honest…</p>

<p>Here are the NXT: LVL UP results from Orlando…</p>

<h2 id="match-1-odyssey-jones-defeated-damon-kemp">Match #1: Odyssey Jones defeated Damon Kemp.</h2>
<p>Kemp worked on Jones’ left arm during the match until Jones came back and won with a Black Hole Slam. <strong>My score: 2/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-2-sol-ruca-defeated-valentina-feroz-in-four-and-a-half-minutes">Match #2: Sol Ruca defeated Valentina Feroz in four and a half minutes.</h2>
<p>Sol picked up her second win with a backflip from the middle rope into a cutter. <strong>My score: 2/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="main-event-trick-williams-defeated-ikemen-jiro">Main event: Trick Williams defeated Ikemen Jiro.</h2>
<p>Jiro went for the Ikemen Slash, but missed and it allowed Williams to win with the Trick Kick. <strong>My score: 2.5/5</strong></p>

<h1 id="progress-chapter-145-wrestling-witch-face--trick-or-treat">Progress Chapter 145: Wrestling Witch Face – Trick Or Treat</h1>

<p>Let’s kick things off with a belated Progress recap that took place one weekend before Halloween.</p>

<p>The 145th chapter of Progress took place on October 23 at the Electric Ballroom in London, England in the United Kingdom; commentators Olie Spring and SoCal Val were disguised as—my favorite commentary duo—Jim Ross and Jerry “The King” Lawler respectively, and one of the fans in attendance was disguised as AEW wrestler Orange Cassidy.</p>

<p>Nine matches were on the card that night; they included two matches that served as the semifinal round of the Natural Progression Series tournament, a knockout only match, an eight-woman tag team match, and three championship matches including one where wXw gold was on the line.</p>

<p>Out of the championship matches that took place, my favorite would go to the Progress Atlas Championship match between Big Damo and Luke Jacobs. Each Atlas Championship bout has impressed me time and time again ever since that belt was revived early this year. This match was indeed one of them that had me grinning from ear to ear, and it was as good as the last time we saw the two wrestlers fight for the title; the story was much different however with Damo coming in as the champion instead of the challenger, and in the end, it was the “Beast of Belfast” that retained the belt.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2022-12-27/wrestling witch face.png" alt="progress wrestling witch face" class="restrict-width" /></p>

<p>As for the regular matches, there were two bouts that became my favorites of this chapter. One was the beginning of the semifinal round of the NPS that kicked off the event; this match was between Ricky Knight Jr. and Leon Slater. This wasn’t the first time that they encountered each other; Knight defeated Slater eleven chapters ago, and fast forward to this chapter, it was the same song and dance but with a spot to the final round of the tournament on the line. Both Knight and Slater fought tooth and nail for that spot, and in the end, it was Knight who emerged victorious. Just like their first encounter, their second one—in the aforementioned tournament this time—was amazing from start to finish.</p>

<p>The other match was the tag team match between FSU and Danny Black and Callum Newman. As we saw in the last chapter, FSU worked like a well-oiled machine as if they never split up—or fought each other outside Progress such as NXT UK—in the first place. They did so again this time by facing half of CPF who also had a strong showing, high flying moments and all, in this match; in the end, FSU picked up the 1-2-3.</p>

<p>Here are the match results from London…</p>

<h2 id="match-1-ricky-knight-jr-defeated-leon-slater-in-the-semifinal-round-of-the-natural-progression-series-tournament">Match #1: Ricky Knight Jr. defeated Leon Slater in the semifinal round of the Natural Progression Series tournament.</h2>
<p>As soon as the bell rang, Slater hit Knight with a shotgun dropkick, a tope con giro and a 450 for two. Near the end, Knight hit Slater with a Styles Clash for two until Slater came back with a poison rana; Slater went for another 450, but missed and it allowed Knight to hit him with a clothesline and an Ehrenmann Driver (ala Bobby Gunns) for the win. Knight helped up Slater and patted him on the back afterwards. <strong>My score: 4.25/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-2-anthony-ogogo-w-adebayo-akinfenwa-defeated-malik-w-kosta-konstantino-roadfam-db-and-2-step-in-a-knockout-only-match">Match #2: Anthony Ogogo (w/ Adebayo Akinfenwa) defeated Malik (w/ Kosta Konstantino, Roadfam, DB and 2-Step) in a Knockout Only match.</h2>
<p>Malik and his cohorts are collectively known as the 265 OGs. Ogogo also had two gentlemen besides footballer (or “soccer player” as we Americans say) Akinfenwa, but weren’t identified for some reason. Malik blindsided Ogogo before the match after Konstantino distracted the referee. After Malik blocked the pop-up punch, Ogogo threw him out of the ring and hit him with a slingshot crossbody before the two fought in the crowd and to the bar (where Ogogo took down the rest of the 265 OGs that stepped in); the two then went to the entryway where Ogogo hit Malik with what looked like a belly-to-belly flatliner on the floor before Malik suplexed Ogogo on the stage and then, courtesy of Konstantino, hit his opponent’s right hand on the steps that were part of the entryway. The fight went back into the crowd where Ogogo hit Malik with a garbage bag and then threw the trashcan into the ring, and then suplexed him into the chairs in the audience.</p>

<p>As soon as the action returned to the ring, Konstantino pulled Malik out of the ring until Ogogo hit the OGs—and a couple crewman—with a Swanton at ringside; the two returned where Ogogo puled Malik in a trashcan and clotheslined him until Konstantino interfered once again and threw a fire extinguisher in the ring. Ogogo hit Malik with a low blow, and Konstantino sprayed “The Guv’nor” with the extinguisher before accidentally hitting the “Hitta” with it; this allowed Ogogo to take off one of his gloves and hit Malik with a right hook before punching him down for the win. Afterwards, one of the OGs—DB, I believe—ran in and got taken down by Ogogo and Akinfenwa; Konstantino said that he wanted a fair fight after seeing what happened until Ogogo and Akinfenwa decided to challenge him and Malik to a tag team match. <strong>My score: 2.75/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-3-nina-samuels-defeated-alexxis-falcon">Match #3: Nina Samuels defeated Alexxis Falcon.</h2>
<p>Nina wore bunny ears, a bowtie and a cottontail as if she were a Playboy bunny. After Alexxis hit Nina with a running jumping neckbreaker for two and then hit her with the Sleeping Beauty, Nina pretended to have a facial injury and then—while Alexxis was pulling her back to the center of the ring—yanked off the middle turnbuckle pad; while the referee fixed the padding, Nina hit Alexxis with her award (that we saw two chapters ago) for the win. Afterwards, Nina got to the stage and welcomed the fans to “the homecoming edition of the Nina Samuels Show” and received a bouquet of flowers; Alexxis called her a moron and said that it wasn’t over yet, then wondered if Nina hasn’t seen many horror movies. Then, the lights went out, and when they came back on, Nina—in a scene straight out of “Carrie”—was covered in blood. (I’m surprised that Alexxis didn’t say “They’re all gonna laugh at you!” afterwards…lol…) <strong>My score: 1.5/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-4-tate-mayfairs-defeated-nico-angelo-in-the-semifinal-round-of-the-natural-progression-series-tournament">Match #4: Tate Mayfairs defeated Nico Angelo in the semifinal round of the Natural Progression Series tournament.</h2>
<p>Simon Miller refused to introduce Mayfairs, dropping the microphone and leaving; Mayfairs then did the intro himself, and then argued with the referee until Angelo threw him into a corner, seconds before the bell rang. Towards the end, Mayfairs hit Angelo with a double underhook DDT and a spinning piledriver for two, then snuck out brass knuckles from one of the turnbuckle pads; Angelo hit Mayfairs with a steamroller-like Death Valley Driver and a shooting star press from two, then Mayfairs kicked him into the referee before hitting him with the knuckles and pinning him for the win. After the match, Mayfairs raised his unconscious opponent’s arm and pretended to get a handshake from him. <strong>My score: 3/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-5-fsu-defeated-danny-black--callum-newman">Match #5: FSU defeated Danny Black &amp; Callum Newman.</h2>
<p>Joe Lando was supposed to be in this match, but was out of action due to injury. During the match, Eddie Dennis got frustrated until Mark Andrews found a luchador mask and handed it to him; Dennis put on the mask and became “Eddie Mysterio”, then fought Black and Newman before unmasking himself and hitting Black with a chokeslam before pinning him in the same style as the Undertaker for two. Near the end, Andrews hit his opponents with the House Light Overdrive (double Pele) until Black hit him with a Spanish Fly and then Dennis with the Out of the Black at ringside; then Andrews hit Black with a tope suicida before Newman hit FSU with a moonsault at ringside. FSU came back and hit ½ of CPF with a Severed Bridge/apron heel kick combo before hitting Newman with a Neck Stop Drier/double stomp combo for the win. FSU showed respect to Black and Newman afterwards. <strong>My score: 4.25/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-6-maggot-defeated-man-like-dereiss-to-retain-the-wxw-shotgun-championship">Match #6: Maggot defeated Man Like Dereiss to retain the wXw Shotgun Championship.</h2>
<p>Before the match started, Elijah talked about his hot streak and “The Rise of Elijah”, then called out Charles Crowley who appeared looking like a barefoot hobo and said that the numbers in a cryptic message that Elijah saw two chapters ago; Crowley said that the numbers were Elijah’s wins and losses before noting that he never lost to the same person twice; Elijah noted that Crowley was someone that he lost to in the past, challenging him to a match for the next chapter. After Elijah left, Maggot appeared wearing the same coat and hat that Crowley wore in the past, and it caused Crowley to freak out and leave. Then, Dereiss came into the ring and dedicated this championship match to his friend Owen who passed away. Maggot hit Dereiss with an F5, then Dereiss recovered and hit Maggot with a sit out powerbomb for two; Dereiss then hit Maggot with a tope suicida, then went for the Four Fiddy, but Maggot dodged it and hit him with a spear for a near fall. Dereiss then hit Maggot with a superplex for two until Maggot surprised him with a rollup for the win. After the match, Dereiss took the belt in frustration until Maggot settled him down and the two hugged it out before he got his belt back. <strong>My score: 3.75/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-7-the-lana-austin-experience--taonga-defeated-rhio-millie-mckenzie-baby-allison--kanji">Match #7: The Lana Austin Experience &amp; Taonga defeated Rhio, Millie McKenzie, Baby Allison &amp; Kanji.</h2>
<p>This was the Progress debut of wXw wrestler Allison. All of the competitors, except for Lana, had a shoving match before the bell rang until the referee and ring crew separated them; as the match then began, all hell broke loose again with Lana watching from the apron as if brawls weren’t her cup of tea. The end of the match saw Taonga hitting Kanji with the I’m Prettier followed by—after Lana blind tagged in—a running punt before Lana stole the pin while L.A. Taylor held back Taonga. After the match, Taonga was livid until Lana, L.A. and Skye Smitson beat her down and left. <strong>My score: 3.25/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-8-big-damo-defeated-luke-jacobs-to-retain-the-progress-atlas-championship">Match #8: Big Damo defeated Luke Jacobs to retain the Progress Atlas Championship.</h2>
<p>Jacobs’ right arm gave out during his chop exchange with Damo. After Jacobs punted Damo twice for a two count and then put him in a sleeper before Damo had his feet on the bottom rope, he hit him with a piledriver and the Burning Lariat for a near fall followed by a powerbomb for another two; Damo came back and hit Jacobs with a fisherman’s superplex, a Wasteland, a senton and the Belfast Blitz for two…then hit him with five more—with the first one to the spine—Belfast Blitzes for the win! Afterwards, Damo helped up Jacobs and shook his hand. <strong>My score: 4/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="main-event-spike-trivet-w-bullit-defeated-dan-moloney-to-retain-the-progress-world-championship">Main event: Spike Trivet (w/ Bullit) defeated Dan Moloney to retain the Progress World Championship.</h2>
<p>It looked like there were cracks in the friendship between Trivet and Bullit as Trivet coerced his bodyguard to leave; it turned out to be all a ruse as Bullit ran back in and attacked Moloney out of the ring, then busted him open after sending him face first into a post. As Bullit—who attacked three crewmen afterwards—was sent to the back, Moloney—on spaghetti legs—came back in and wanted to compete even though it gave Trivet the upper hand in the beginning per se. Trivet hit Moloney with the Madame Guillotine for a near fall until Moloney spat at him, leading to Trivet snapping his nose and hitting him with the Birthright for another near fall; then, Trivet fought Moloney in a corner before elbowing the original referee Oscar which allowed Bullit to return and hand him the championship belt.</p>

<p>Moloney hit Bullit with a low blow until Trivet struck him with the title and punched him down, then the two brought in two steel chairs until Man Like Dereiss ran in and went after the two including diving onto Bullit—and the crewmen—at ringside. Moloney recovered and hit Trivet with a spear and, seconds before the second referee Tom ran in, the Drilla for a near fall; Moloney then came close to taking his frustration out on Tom until Trivet hit him with a low blow before Moloney came back with a piledriver and the second Drilla. Bullit pulled referee Tom out of the ring and then hit Dereiss with a chokeslam on the apron, then Moloney fought Bullit until Trivet hit him with one of the chairs, Bullit crotched him, and Trivet hit him with a package piledriver for a near fall before nailing the second one for the win. (Trivet’s previous theme song, the one I jokingly called the “Steven Bochco Productions” theme song one time, was played after the match for some reason.)</p>

<p>After the match, Dereiss ran in until Bullit took him down before leaving with Trivet while Dereiss checked on his 0121 teammate; Dereiss would help up Moloney and walk him to the back afterwards. <strong>My score: 3/5</strong></p>

<h1 id="wxw-inner-circle-12">wXw Inner Circle 12</h1>

<p>Staying in Europe, we head to the wXw Wrestling Academy in its new location Gelsenkirchen, Germany for the 12th wXw Inner Circle. (And yes, it has been a while since I have done recaps of wXw events.)</p>

<p>Inner Circle took place on September 30; it was the first time that this event took place at the Academy’s new home Gelsenkirchen. Described by ring announcer Thomas Giesen, Inner Circle is like “an event in a small circle” hence the name; it involves up-and-comers from in and outside Europe clashing with current members of the wXw roster.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2022-12-27/wxw inner circle.png" alt="wxw inner circle" class="restrict-width" /></p>

<p>Eight matches took place that day, and my favorite match of the event would go to the one-on-one match between Gulyás Jr. and Akira. Gulyás Jr. has been doing very well in his wXw tenure since he debuted for the company in early 2021, and he—along with his opponent Akira who made his wXw debut—had a great showing in this bout; part of me may be surprised that his farmer gimmick—“pit stop” armpit and all—didn’t come into play, but it was good to see more of his competitive side in this match. Plus, I look forward to seeing more of Akira in the near future after seeing him clash with Gulyás Jr. whether it’s in wXw or another company.</p>

<p>Here are the match results from Gelsenkirchen…</p>

<h2 id="match-1-orsi-defeated-jacob-crane">Match #1: Orsi defeated Jacob Crane.</h2>
<p>Crane hugged the referee near the end of the match and attempted to kick Orsi until Orsi blocked the kick; she then won with a spear. <strong>My score: 0.5/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-2-kevin-ku-w-dominic-garrini-defeated-danny-miles">Match #2: Kevin Ku (w/ Dominic Garrini) defeated Danny Miles.</h2>
<p>Miles put Ku in the Chase Your Dream (rear naked choke) until Ku got out of it and put him in a heel hook. Then, Miles went for a cannonball, but missed and it allowed Ku to win with a fisherman’s buster. <strong>My score: 3/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-3-gulyás-jr-defeated-akira">Match #3: Gulyás Jr. defeated Akira.</h2>
<p>As noted above, this was Akira’s wXw debut; the American deathmatch wrestler is not to be confused with the same wrestler that goes by the names “Francesco Akira” and, especially on wXw, “Akira Francesco.” Akira had an eyepatch over his left eye because it was damaged during a match that involved a razor board. Both shook hands as soon as the match began. Akira worked on Gulyás Jr.’s right arm until Gulyás Jr. came back and scored a two count after a cannonball. Akira fought back and hit Gulyás Jr. with a Shadow Star (top rope senton) for a near fall before Gulyás Jr. hit him with a Michinoku driver for two; then, Akira countered a clothesline with a cross armbreaker until Gulyás Jr. hit him with a powerbomb and held onto him for the winning pin. <strong>My score: 4/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-4-the-boricua-boys-defeated-elijah-blum--danny-fray">Match #4: The Boricua Boys defeated Elijah Blum &amp; Danny Fray.</h2>
<p>The Boricua Boys consist of Dante Caballero and Joe Keys. Fray cleaned house until, behind the referee’s back, Caballero wrapped a belt around his fist and punched Fray with it; Caballero and Keys then hit Fray with a Claymore/German suplex combo (known as the Drive By which may make Roman Reigns, and the rest of the Bloodline, blush) for the win. Norman Harras appeared and chatted with the Boricua Boys afterwards. <strong>My score: 2/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-5-fuminori-abe-defeated-masha-slamovich">Match #5: Fuminori Abe defeated Masha Slamovich.</h2>
<p>Both wrestlers fought at ringside where Abe attempted to punch Masha until he missed and hit the wall instead, leading to Masha getting the upper hand. The end of the match saw Abe making Masha submit to an octopus. After the match, both shook hands until Masha slapped Abe and stormed off. <strong>My score: 3/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-6-shazza-mckenzie--killer-kelly-defeated-ava-everett--iva-kolasky">Match #6: Shazza McKenzie &amp; Killer Kelly defeated Ava Everett &amp; Iva Kolasky.</h2>
<p>Before the match started, Ava welcomed herself back to Germany, then called herself “the best wXw Women’s Champion of all time” and Iva “second best.” Almost two minutes into the match, Ava refused to tag in unless Kelly was tagged in; Ava and Kelly were tagged in afterwards, even though Ava—along with Iva—still fought Shazza a minute or so later. The match ended with Kelly hitting Iva with a rolling Death Valley Driver for the win. <strong>My score: 3/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-7-icarus-defeated-dominic-garrini">Match #7: Icarus defeated Dominic Garrini.</h2>
<p>Dover was not in attendance due to injury. Icarus choked Garrini with the tag rope during the match. Garrini came back and hit Icarus with a powerbomb for two before putting him in a Boston crab; Icarus got out of the hold and fought back, then hit him with the Meltdown (Swanton) for a near fall. Near the end, Garrini hit Icarus with a pumphandle driver until Icarus got his feet on the middle rope, then put him in a rear naked choke until Icarus—while in the hold—sent his opponent headfirst into a top turnbuckle before bridging him for the win. <strong>My score: 2.5/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="main-event-shigehiro-irie-defeated-peter-tihanyi">Main event: Shigehiro Irie defeated Peter Tihanyi.</h2>
<p>During the match, Tihanyi hit Irie with a springboard Meteora for two followed by a tope suicida, then went for a tornado DDT but got his leg tangled in the ropes; this allowed Irie to hit him with a Boss Man Slam before Tihanyi blocked his top rope splash attempt. Towards the end, Irie splashed Tihanyi against the ropes a handful of times (before nearly falling out of the ring), and then won with the Beast Bomber clothesline. Tihanyi raised Irie’s arm and hugged him afterwards. <strong>My score: 3.75/5</strong></p>

<h1 id="nxt-deadline">NXT Deadline</h1>

<p>We now head to Orlando, Florida in the United States, and also jump to the month of December; cue “Puppeteer” by Rightfield featuring Emotional Xan because it’s time to look back at NXT Deadline!</p>

<p>It was the first time ever that NXT held an event known as “Deadline”, and it also marked the last WWE premium live event (or pay-per-view event if you’re old school like me) of 2022; it was also the last time that NXT held a premium live event at the WWE Performance Center’s arena (the former Capital Wrestling Center) in Orlando before the brand announced that their premium live events would take place outside the city starting with Vengeance Day on February 4, 2023. The long-awaited Iron Survivor Challenge matches took place that night along with two championship matches and one singles match.</p>

<p>Deadline was, in my opinion, a great way to wrap up WWE’s year of premium live events. Not only was I impressed with both the men’s and women’s Iron Survivor Challenge matches, but also the rest of the card including the NXT Championship match that served as the main event.</p>

<p>Onto the Iron Survivor Challenge matches, both the men and women didn’t disappoint me one bit in their—as well as our—first taste of this type of bout. Not only did we see the wrestlers fighting tooth and nail for title shots that were on the line as well as how many falls they needed (via pinfall, submission or disqualification), but also a great amount of action from the five women and five men. In my honest opinion, I would love to see more Iron Survivor Challenges take place in the near future, whether it’s on a special episode of any of WWE’s brands or at a premium live event.</p>

<p>As for the championship matches, I honestly didn’t expect the New Day to win gold on NXT, even though in the past we have seen wrestlers from other brands win gold elsewhere such as Dolph Ziggler on NXT, Josh Briggs &amp; Brooks Jensen on NXT UK, and—back in 2018—Moustache Mountain (P.S.: Good luck to Trent Seven on his run in AEW!) winning the NXT Tag Team Championship per se. On the other hand, I’m glad to see this great team (and yes, I still consider Big E as a member of the New Day) win gold on NXT besides Raw and SmackDown; besides, I like seeing teams such as the New Day, the Usos and FTR—just to name a few—to make names for themselves when it comes to how much they dominate one tag team division after another.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2022-12-27/nxt deadline.png" alt="nxt deadline" class="restrict-width" /></p>

<p>Not only did I like the Iron Survivor Challenge matches, but I also like the main event which became my favorite match of the event; as I mentioned, the match was for the NXT Championship. Breakker noted in one of his meetings with Apollo Crews—outside the WWE Performance Center as we’ve seen on past episodes of NXT heading into this event—that his three in-ring abilities are power, intensity and speed; Crews, in this main event, challenged all three of those abilities—as promised in one of his meetings with Breakker—in this championship match that night even by either matching those three abilities or making his own three greater than his opponent’s.</p>

<p>This was indeed a great championship match where those aforementioned abilities played a role courtesy of those two competitors, and in the end, it was Breakker retaining the championship. For Crews, with performances such as this one, I still think he’ll be winning gold sooner or later even after coming close to NXT’s metaphoric brass ring—the NXT Championship—that night; to me, it’s not even close to over for Crews and his time on the white-and-gold brand. As for Breakker, his championship defenses continue to be impressive—during his second reign as NXT Champion—time and time again, and his second reign continues to be stronger by the minute as we’ve seen on NXT as well as its premium live events.</p>

<p>Here are the Deadline results from Orlando…</p>

<h2 id="match-1-roxanne-perez-defeated-zoey-stark-kiana-james-cora-jade-and-indi-hartwell-in-the-womens-iron-survivor-challenge-to-become-the-1-contender-for-the-nxt-womens-championship">Match #1: Roxanne Perez defeated Zoey Stark, Kiana James, Cora Jade and Indi Hartwell in the Women’s Iron Survivor Challenge to become the #1 contender for the NXT Women’s Championship.</h2>
<p>Roxanne and Zoey started the match, then Kiana was the third entrant, followed by Cora and Indi in that order. Zoey picked up fall #1 after hitting Roxanne with the Z360, Cora picked up her first fall after hitting Roxanne—who attempted to hit Kiana with the Pop Rox—with a superkick before pinning Kiana, Indi picked up her first fall after a big boot to Roxanne, Roxanne picked up fall #1 after countering Zoey’s Z360 with a rollup, and Roxanne picked up fall #2 after hitting Cora with the Pop Rox. Booker T cried tears of joy on commentary after seeing Roxanne win. <strong>My score: 3.75/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-2-isla-dawn-defeated-alba-fyre">Match #2: Isla Dawn defeated Alba Fyre.</h2>
<p>Isla exposed the middle turnbuckle during the match. After Alba hit Isla with a tope suicida and the Fyre Bomb on the floor for a near fall, Isla grabbed the referee—who was sprayed in the face with the black mist on NXT days prior—until Alba hit her with the Swanton; the referee was unable to make the pin count as he ended up hemorrhaging the black mist. The second referee came to perform the pin count and then check on the original referee, then Isla sent Alba into the exposed turnbuckle before winning with an elbow drop neckbreaker. <strong>My score: 3/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-3-the-new-day-defeated-pretty-deadly-to-become-the-new-nxt-tag-team-champions">Match #3: The New Day defeated Pretty Deadly to become the new NXT Tag Team Champions.</h2>
<p>During the match, Kofi Kingston and Elton Prince had what the fans called a “twerk off” as both competitors danced as if “Shake Your Booty” by KC and the Sunshine Band was playing in the arena. There were Eddie Guerrero moments near the end of the match as both teams went back and forth on pretending to be hit by the tag team belts until the referee saw all four down. Then, Kit Wilson hit Xavier Woods with one of the belts behind the referee’s back for two; Pretty Deadly then went for the Spilled Milk until Kingston got Wilson out of the ring and hit him with Trouble In Paradise, then the New Day hit Prince with the Midnight Hour for the win. Woods and Kingston celebrated in the crowd afterwards. <strong>My score: 3.5/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-4-grayson-waller-defeated-jd-mcdonagh-axiom-carmelo-hayes-and-joe-gacy-in-the-mens-iron-survivor-challenge-to-become-the-1-contender-for-the-nxt-championship">Match #4: Grayson Waller defeated JD McDonagh, Axiom, Carmelo Hayes and Joe Gacy in the Men’s Iron Survivor Challenge to become the #1 contender for the NXT Championship.</h2>
<p>McDonagh and Axiom started the match, then Hayes was the third entrant, followed by Waller and Gacy in that order. Hayes slammed McDonagh onto Axiom before pinning Axiom for fall #1; Waller hit Axiom and McDonagh with a double through-the-ropes cutter to score his first two falls of the match; Axiom picked up his first fall after a headscissors rollup to Waller, and then his second fall after a poison rana and the Golden Ratio to McDonagh; Gacy got fall #1 after making Axiom submit to a Rings of Saturn, and then fall #2 after hitting Hayes with the Upside Down World; Hayes got his second fall after making Waller submit to a crossface; and Waller, after Hayes hit Axiom with the Nothing But Net, punched Hayes away and pinned Axiom for his third fall before his opponents chased him as if he were Benny Hill until the clock ran out. <strong>My score: 3.75/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="main-event-bron-breakker-defeated-apollo-crews-to-retain-the-nxt-championship">Main event: Bron Breakker defeated Apollo Crews to retain the NXT Championship.</h2>
<p>Breakker’s entrance had pictures of his championship defenses, and then he would burst through a screen—that was showing those pictures—while heading to the ring. Halfway through the match, Crews closed his eyes while his opponent was down and then opened them back up as if he powered up. After Breakker hit Crews with a Steiner bulldog for a near fall, he went for a powerslam until Crews countered it with a DDT for two; Crews’ pop-up uranage was then blocked as was—after Breakker hit him with his own pop-up uranage for two—Breakker’s powerslam before Crews hit him with his own powerslam for two. The two continued to go at it back and forth until Breakker won with a spear. After the match, Grayson Waller ran in and hit Breakker with a through-the-ropes cutter before posing with the title. <strong>My score: 4.25/5</strong></p>

<h1 id="icw-fight-club">ICW Fight Club</h1>

<p>Returning to the United Kingdom, we’re go to the Northumbria University Students Union in Newcastle Upon Tyne, England for an episode of ICW Fight Club.</p>

<p>On the go-home episode of Fight Club prior to Fear &amp; Loathing XIV, there were four matches that took place; it started off slow until the episode picked up one notch after another. My favorite match of the episode would have to go to a warmup match, but this time, it didn’t involve those fighting for the ICW World Heavyweight Champion at F&amp;L (even though Leyton Buzzard vs. Kez Evans was still good per se); this time, it involved one of the wrestlers getting ready for a King of Insanity match at that event.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2022-12-27/icw deathmatch.jpg" alt="icw deathmatch" class="restrict-width" /></p>

<p>The match I enjoyed was the main event which was a deathmatch between BT Gunn and Clint Margera. For those of you that are new to Margera, he’s not related to any of the Margeras—Bam, Jesse, etc.—that we’ve seen in “Jackass” and “Viva La Bam!” or heard in the band CKY; Clint is actually a British deathmatch specialist. Unless you’re not big on deathmatches, it was a very good battle from start to finish, and Gunn was able to boost his momentum by defeating Margera—who also had a strong showing like his opponent—in this match.</p>

<p>Here are the match results from Newcastle Upon Tyne…</p>

<h2 id="match-1-koe-w-jackie-polo-and-denise-defeated-sha-samuels--dirty-dango">Match #1: K.O.E. (w/ “Jackie Polo” and Denise) defeated Sha Samuels &amp; Dirty Dango.</h2>
<p>I wonder how Gene Munny reacted after hearing Billy Kirkwood on commentary call the former Fandango “that damn dirty Dango”…lol…anyway, Denise wore a cast on her neck after getting hit with a polo mallet (or “the hammer” as DCT calls it) by “Polo” on last week’s episode where he and K.O.E. went after Sha Samuels before Glasgow Grindhouse made the save. During the match, “Polo” got distracted after being fingertips away from tripping Samuels.</p>

<p>Near the end, Samuels hit Adam King with the Mug Smasher while Dango hit Marcus King with a tope con giro, then Denise distracted the referee which allowed “Polo” to sneak in and hit Samuels with “the hammer”, making Adam pin him for the win. After the match, “Polo” and K.O.E. attacked Samuels until the Glasgow Grindhouse evened the odds and fought K.O.E. out of the ring; then, Lou King Sharp, Krieger, Samuels and Dango had “Polo” surrounded, and the four fought him out of the ring. Once the smoke cleared, Sharp wanted Dango and Samuels to dance with him and Krieger, and sure enough, all four danced in the ring. <strong>My score: 2/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-2-molly-spartan-defeated-gia-adams-in-a-non-title-match">Match #2: Molly Spartan defeated Gia Adams in a non-title match.</h2>
<p>After Gia made a comeback, Molly powerbombed her off the top rope and then won with a spear. After the match, Molly helped up Gia and shook her hand, then admitted to being a “pain in the ass” but still cares about the women’s division unlike Kasey; she then said that knows that she scares Kasey like the rest of the women’s division, and that their match at Fear &amp; Loathing XIV would go down in history. <strong>My score: 3/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-3-kez-evans-defeated-leyton-buzzard-in-a-non-title-match">Match #3: Kez Evans defeated Leyton Buzzard in a non-title match.</h2>
<p>Evans’ brass knuckles fell out of his gear during the match, and then purposely rearranged the turnbuckle padding in order to—when the referee fixed the pad—find the knuckles. Buzzard’s lower back was worked on during the match, and he was unable to hit Evans with the Buzzkiller at one point. After Evans rubbed the ICW World Heavyweight Championship belt in Buzzard’s face, he put him in the Blood Clot Clutch until Buzzard got out of it with a snapmare followed by a superkick; Buzzard then went for the X Marks the Spot, but missed, which allowed Evans to have time to put on the knuckles.</p>

<p>Buzzard dodged the knuckles and hit Evans with another superkick followed by the Buzzkiller for a near fall, then took the knuckles from him until Evans hit him with the belt for the win. After the match, Evans continued to beat down Buzzard until Craig Anthony ran in and fought him; Anthony and Buzzard argued physically and verbally while going after Evans, then Stevie James ran in and threw Evans—who attempted to sneak out—back in the ring and hit him with a superkick before posing with the title. Then, Buzzard hit James with the Buzzkiller and posed with the belt, Anthony hit Buzzard with a discus forearm and posed with the belt, and Evans blindsided Anthony before walking away with the belt. <strong>My score: 3.25/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="main-event-bt-gunn-defeated-clint-margera-in-a-deathmatch">Main event: BT Gunn defeated Clint Margera in a deathmatch.</h2>
<p>Light tubes, an ironing board, some beer from the bar, a table, a staple gun, steel chairs, thumbtacks and skewers came into play in this match. (There was also a guitar with tubes taped to the back, but it wasn’t used for some reason.) Moments included both wrestlers fighting to the bar where Gunn had a drink and Margera splashed him with one, Margera hitting Gunn with a side Russian leg sweep from the bottom rope and through the table at ringside, Gunn attempted to break a tube on the back of Margera’s neck until Margera broke it himself, Margera piercing the palms of Gunn’s hands with the staple gun and then Gunn—after Margera was preoccupied with pouring tacks from the bag—piercing his opponent’s groin with that same weapon, and Gunn giving Margera the Ric Flair treatment by throwing him off the top rope and into two chairs—with tubes on them—and tacks. The match ended with Gunn battering Margera with skewers and tubes, and then hitting him with the Temple Tap roundhouse kick for the win. After the match, Jack Jester appeared at the entryway and looked at his Fear &amp; Loathing opponent Gunn. <strong>My score: 3.75/5</strong></p>

<h1 id="nxt">NXT</h1>

<p>Returning to Orlando, it’s time for an episode of NXT!</p>

<p>The fallout episode of NXT after Deadline began with announcements that the Iron Survivor Challenge winners would fight for the championship belts at New Year’s Evil, which takes place on January 10, 2023 on USA Network. However, one of those championship matches was moved from next year to this past Tuesday.</p>

<p>Roxanne Perez attempted to talk about her win until Grayson Waller, who came to the arena in a Hummer, appeared in a crowd and bragged about his win and how he got the victory before Bron Breakker appeared and chased him. While the Waller/Breakker chase went on, Mandy Rose came elsewhere from the crowd and blindsided Perez with the NXT Women’s Championship belt; Roxanne recovered and decided to fight Mandy for the gold this week on NXT.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2022-12-27/nxt roxanne.jpg" alt="nxt roxanne perez" class="restrict-width" /></p>

<p>Roxanne Perez vs. Mandy Rose became the main event for this week’s episode of NXT, and it was indeed a great way to wrap up the episode (and was also my favorite match of the episode). Roxanne has been on a roll as of late ever since she began her WWE tenure back in April, and she definitely deserved to win gold this week after accomplishing a whole lot month after month. As for Mandy, all I can say is that she had a great dominant run as the champion since the Halloween Havoc episode of NXT back in late October of 2021, lasting it for over a year just like Asuka and Shayna Baszler has in the past. I definitely look forward to seeing Roxanne and her reign as champion in the near future, and I’m pretty sure those that saw her win the Ring of Honor Women’s Championship over a year ago would think the same thing as well.</p>

<p>Here are the NXT results from Orlando…</p>

<h2 id="match-1-wes-lee-defeated-stacks-w-tony-dangelo-in-a-non-title-match">Match #1: Wes Lee defeated Stacks (w/ Tony D’Angelo) in a non-title match.</h2>
<p>Stacks fought Lee backstage and to the ring before the match began; he would work on Lee’s back later on. Lee would come back and win with a backflip heel kick. After the match, Dijak came into the ring and stared at Lee, which then allowed D’Angelo to attack Lee from behind. (I think we’ll see a triple threat match for the NXT North American Championship in the near future…perhaps New Year’s Evil?) <strong>My score: 2.5/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-2-gigi-dolin--jacy-jayne-defeated-tatum-paxley--ivy-nile-by-disqualification-in-almost-two-and-a-half-minutes">Match #2: Gigi Dolin &amp; Jacy Jayne defeated Tatum Paxley &amp; Ivy Nile by disqualification in almost two and a half minutes.</h2>
<p>Kayden Carter &amp; Katana Chance joined Vic Joseph and Booker T on commentary. Jacy threw Ivy into the NXT Women’s Tag Team Champions until Kayden and Katana went after her and Gigi, giving the Toxic Attraction members the DQ win. All three teams brawled afterwards until referees came and separated them; the three teams would then brawl again backstage later that night. <strong>My score: 0.5/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-3-odyssey-jones-w-malik-blade-and-edris-enofé-defeated-von-wagner-w-mr-stone-in-almost-three-minutes">Match #3: Odyssey Jones (w/ Malik Blade and Edris Enofé) defeated Von Wagner (w/ Mr. Stone) in almost three minutes.</h2>
<p>Mr. Stone wore a tuxedo, which led to Vic Joseph calling him a “bum ass James Bond” on commentary. Near the end, Mr. Stone stole Blade’s sweater, and Enofé chased him; while the referee eyed on the chase, Blade kicked Wagner from ringside before Jones won with a running crossbody. <strong>My score: 0.5/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-4-ikemen-jiro-defeated-javier-bernal-in-three-minutes">Match #4: Ikemen Jiro defeated Javier Bernal in three minutes.</h2>
<p>Bernal teased throwing Jiro into the audience, and then laughed about it until Jiro surprised him with a crossbody (that unfortunately got the “didn’t get all of it” treatment). Jiro would then go on to win with the Ikemen Slash. After the match, Scrypts ran in and attacked Jiro, then took the jacket off of him and put it on. <strong>My score: 0.5/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-5-jd-mcdonagh-defeated-brutus-creed-w-julius-creed-in-four-minutes">Match #5: JD McDonagh defeated Brutus Creed (w/ Julius Creed) in four minutes.</h2>
<p>Brutus’ left forearm was worked on after McDonagh slammed it on the announce table. Indus Sher appeared later on. Near the end, McDonagh punted both Creed Brothers, then grabbed a steel chair until Sanga took it away from him; instead, he hit Brutus with the Devil Inside on the floor followed by a second Devil Inside in the ring for the win. Both Veer Mahaan and Sanga nodded at the Creed Brothers in disappointment afterwards. <strong>My score: 1/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-6-lyra-valkyria-defeated-amari-miller-in-three-minutes">Match #6: Lyra Valkyria defeated Amari Miller in three minutes.</h2>
<p>Lyra is actually former NXT UK wrestler Aoife Valkyrie. She won after hitting Amari with a frog splash. <strong>My score: 1/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-7-duke-hudson-w-andre-chase-and-thea-hail-defeated-damon-kemp-in-almost-four-minutes">Match #7: Duke Hudson (w/ Andre Chase and Thea Hail) defeated Damon Kemp in almost four minutes.</h2>
<p>Drew Gulak, whom Hudson was with early in the episode, appeared until Chase shooed him away. The match ended after Hudson hit Kemp with a Bionic Elbow (ala the late Dusty Rhodes) followed by a running big boot for the win. <strong>My score: 1.5/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="main-event-roxanne-perez-defeated-mandy-rose-to-become-the-new-nxt-womens-champion">Main event: Roxanne Perez defeated Mandy Rose to become the new NXT Women’s Champion.</h2>
<p>During the match, Roxanne went for the Pop Rox on the floor until Mandy sent her into the steel stairs, and then worked on her right arm. Towards the end, Mandy went for the Kiss By the Rose until Roxanne countered with a rollup for two before Mandy put her in a crossface; Roxanne got out of the hold by rolling up Mandy for another two until Mandy hit her with the Kiss By the Rose for a near fall. Mandy looked to finish off Roxanne with a double underhook maneuver until Roxanne came back and hit her with the Pop Rox for the win. Booker T celebrated Roxanne’s win on commentary afterwards. <strong>My score: 3/5</strong></p>

<h1 id="nxt-lvl-up">NXT: LVL UP</h1>

<p>Staying in Orlando, we wrap things up with an episode of NXT: LVL UP.</p>

<p>Interesting to note, the second and third matches were taped prior to NXT Deadline; the dead giveaway was the Iron Survivor Challenge penalty box being seen at ringside.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2022-12-27/nxt lvl up chase u.jpg" alt="nxt lvl up 2" class="restrict-width" /></p>

<p>My favorite out of the three matches would be the tag team main event between Chase U members Andre Chase &amp; Duke Hudson and the team of Javier Bernal &amp; Xyon Quinn. Besides seeing both teams giving us a good amount of competition, their characters and storylines came into play very well; not only did we see Bernal and Quinn doing good portrayals of cocky self-centered heels, but also Chase and Hudson trying to gel as a team including Chase wanting his tag team partner to focus on fighting and not cheating. Lessons were indeed learned, and it paid off for the Chase U members as they ended up chalking up a win. Yes, Chase U has grown on me as I’ve noted in the very early issues, and seeing Hudson work as one of Chase’s classmates in the storyline—as well as cementing his babyface turn—is indeed fun to watch.</p>

<p>Here are the NXT: LVL UP results from Orlando…</p>

<h2 id="match-1-the-dyad-w-joe-gacy-and-ava-raine-defeated-bronco-nima--lucien-price">Match #1: The Dyad (w/ Joe Gacy and Ava Raine) defeated Bronco Nima &amp; Lucien Price.</h2>
<p>After Rip Fowler yanked Price into the post, he and Jagger Reid hit Nima with a double Codebreaker for the win. <strong>My score: 1.5/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-2-ivy-nile-defeated-lash-legend">Match #2: Ivy Nile defeated Lash Legend.</h2>
<p>After Lash hit Ivy with a backbreaker, she went for a suplex until Ivy countered with the DCL; Lash tapped out, giving Ivy the win. <strong>My score: 2/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="main-event-andre-chase--duke-hudson-w-thea-hail-defeated-javier-bernal--xyon-quinn">Main event: Andre Chase &amp; Duke Hudson (w/ Thea Hail) defeated Javier Bernal &amp; Xyon Quinn.</h2>
<p>Earlier, Chase told Hudson not to cheat after catching him grabbing Quinn by the hair. The team of Chase and Hudson won after hitting Bernal with the Fratliner. <strong>My score: 2.5/5</strong></p>

<h1 id="next-time">Next time…</h1>

<h1 id="icw-fear--loathing-xiv">ICW Fear &amp; Loathing XIV</h1>

<p>I was unable to do any belated recaps this week (mainly because, as the saying goes, “‘tis the season”), but I am going to kick off this week’s issue with ICW Fear &amp; Loathing XIV.
F&amp;L took place at the Garage in Glasgow, Scotland in the United Kingdom on November 20. It was the second time, for me, to check out ICW’s F&amp;L with the exception that this year’s event took place for one night only instead of two nights like last year’s F&amp;L; I definitely enjoyed my first F&amp;L last year, and I was hungry for this year’s F&amp;L like dogs going after a Christmas turkey in “A Christmas Story.”</p>

<p>On the card that night were ten matches; one was a six-man ladder match where the winner would become the future contender for the ICW Zero-G Championship, four championship matches including one—that served as the main event—that was a fatal four-way elimination match, three regular one-on-one matches, a King of Insanity match and a Last Man Standing match. There were also a couple competitors that returned to ICW including one that was previously in the now defunct NXT UK.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2022-12-27/icw fear and loathing.jpg" alt="icw fear and loathing" class="restrict-width" /></p>

<p>There were three matches, out of the ten, that I enjoyed; two of them were championship matches. The first match that I liked was for the ICW Women’s Championship; Molly Spartan defended the belt against Kasey who teased the end of the She Wolves, ever since the champion came up with this match, besides declaring herself the pinnacle of the women’s division. I’m not going to lie but seeing both members of the She Wolves clash for the belt was definitely worth watching; in the end, it was the “Beautiful Bruiser” Molly who retained the belt even while avoiding Kasey’s mind games in that bout. Not only did we see a great amount of action from both wrestlers, but also the split-up tease come into play before and during the match.</p>

<p>The second match that I liked was the King of Insanity match between BT Gunn and Jack Jester. Unless you’re not a big fan of deathmatches, the KOI matches—which are deathmatches of course—never disappoint me one bit especially those that Gunn participated in from his first KOI match with Stevie Boy who was the “King of Insanity” at that time. This was indeed a great match from start to finish, but this time, it was the “Hardcore Icon” Jester who came out on top besides—like his opponent Gunn—covered head to toe in blood.</p>

<p>I was pretty sure that Gunn would retain the metaphoric crown he received after defeating Stevie Boy last year in that bout, but this match showed that it could have gone either way; as noted, it was Jester who emerged victorious and earned that namesake. As much as I love how Gunn performs in this type of match, it’s definitely good to see a hardcore icon—no pun intended—such as Jester to earn that “crown” after seeing how he and his opponent performed that night with both wrestling maneuvers and weapons.</p>

<p>Lastly, I also enjoyed the fatal four-way elimination match where the ICW World Heavyweight Championship was on the line; Kez Evans defended the belt against Stevie James, Craig Anthony and Leyton Buzzard. The storylines heading into this match were James not yet finished with Evans after almost winning the belt months ago on an episode of ICW Fight Club, Anthony resuming his rivalry with Evans from over a year ago, and Buzzard wanting championship gold after officially cashing in his Square Go! briefcase. I have noted months ago in the very early issues of Pro-Darin that Buzzard definitely deserved to win gold in the future; that statement is still true today, even after seeing “El Capitan” win the belt in this thrilling main event that had “edge of your seat” moments even before eliminations were made.</p>

<p>One more thing, remember when I had trouble with the name of the new interviewer on ICW? Her name is Katt Wolfe; I was finally able to remember that name before checking out F&amp;L. Hopefully, she can forgive me after misnaming her a couple times…</p>

<p>Okay, now that I’m done earning brownie points as well as sighing in relief, let’s take a look at the match results from Glasgow…</p>

<h2 id="match-1-saqib-ali-w-chris-toal-defeated-thatcher-wright-w-ian-skinner-and-mr-charles-vyce-sheikh-el-sham-luke-kyro-levi-and-che-monet-in-a-ladder-match-to-become-the-1-contender-for-the-icw-zero-g-championship">Match #1: Saqib Ali (w/ Chris Toal) defeated Thatcher Wright (w/ Ian Skinner and Mr. Charles Vyce), Sheikh El Sham, Luke Kyro, Levi and Che Monet in a ladder match to become the #1 contender for the ICW Zero-G Championship.</h2>
<p>Toal joined Billy Kirkwood and James R. Kennedy on commentary. As soon as the match began, everyone went at it except for Wright who got a ladder from his Thatcher’s Cabinet members until his opponents noticed this was happening seconds later.</p>

<p>Moments included El Sham dropkicking Levi off the ladder until Monet gave him the Ric Flair treatment by throwing him off the top rope and into most of their opponents at ringside; Ali spinning with the ladder and hitting everybody with it until El Sham hit him with a spear; and a handful of ringside dives such as El Sham hitting his opponent with a corkscrew Plancha, Levi diving from the top of a ladder, and Monet and Wright fighting on the ladder until El Sham powerbombed the “Weapon of Sass Destruction” Monet off the ladder and into the opponents at ringside. The end of the match saw Ali and Wright fight at the top of the ladder, and Ali shoving the Margaret Thatcher book in Wright’s face before getting the briefcase for the win.</p>

<p>After the match, Wright took his frustrations out on Skinner and Vyce until the two attacked him and Skinner hitting the book with a curbstomp. <strong>My score: 2.75/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-2-koe-w-jackie-polo-and-denise-defeated-glasgow-grindhouse-to-become-the-new-icw-tag-team-champions">Match #2: K.O.E. (w/ “Jackie Polo” and Denise) defeated Glasgow Grindhouse to become the new ICW Tag Team Champions.</h2>
<p>As soon as the introductions were wrapped up, Adam and Marcus King blindsided Lou King Sharp and Krieger until the Glasgow Grindhouse fought back including Krieger throwing Sharp out of the ring and into Adam. Sharp cleaned house with his kendo stick earlier until “Polo” took the stick from him, giving the upper hand back to K.O.E. Adam and Marcus ended up winning after hitting Sharp with the Watch the Throne 2.0. <strong>My score: 1/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-3-jason-reed-w-coach-trip-defeated-andy-wild">Match #3: Jason Reed (w/ Coach Trip) defeated Andy Wild.</h2>
<p>Early in the match, Wild chased Reed at ringside until Trip hit him with a steel chair; Reed would then use the chair as a weapon seconds later. Near the end, Wild countered the Club Deck with a back body drop and hit him with a tiger bomb until Trip put Reed’s foot on the bottom rope; then, Trip came in with a chair and Wild punched him before attacking him with the chair until Reed hit Wild with a low blow followed by a Pedigree on the chair for the win. After the match, Wild—in disbelief—said that he didn’t want to do this anymore and that there was no place for him in ICW. <strong>My score: 1.5/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-4-molly-spartan-defeated-kasey-to-retain-the-icw-womens-championship">Match #4: Molly Spartan defeated Kasey to retain the ICW Women’s Championship.</h2>
<p>Kasey appeared at the entryway with the She Wolves flag until she dropped it and kicked it off the stage. As soon as the match began, Molly offered a handshake until Kasey pushed it away. After Kasey threw Molly off the top rope with a Death Valley Driver for two, she hit her opponent with Off With Her Head for a near fall before taking the championship belt and hitting her with it for another two; Kasey then went for the second OWHH, but Molly collapsed before that finisher was attempted. Molly recovered by countering the OWHH with a pop up powerbomb before winning with a spear. After the match, Molly offered a handshake again, and then the two hugged before leaving together and holding up the She Wolves flag that Kasey had before she headed to the ring. <strong>My score: 4/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-5-aaron-echo-defeated-rampage-brown">Match #5: Aaron Echo defeated Rampage Brown.</h2>
<p>Echo was scheduled to fight Chris Bungard in this match, but Bungard was unable to compete in this match because he was scheduled to defend the Cage Warrior Light Heavyweight Championship in London, England; this match ended up being an open challenge by Echo, who told the fans that seeing him getting his ass handed was “not happening”, instead. The end of the match saw Brown, who had the upper hand in the beginning of the match as well as have a strong showing, boot away a discus forearm attempt until Echo sent him into a post before winning with the discus forearm. <strong>My score: 3.5/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-6-jack-jester-defeated-bt-gunn-in-the-king-of-insanity-match">Match #6: Jack Jester defeated BT Gunn in the King of Insanity match.</h2>
<p>A barbed wire table (mistaken as a barbed wire board by Billy Kirkwood and James R. Kennedy for some reason), a barbed wire wrapped “Big Shiny”, a fork (that Jester brandished from his right boot), Jester’s corkscrew, a steel chair, a bucket full of glass, a bag full of thumbtacks, and a barbed wire chair came into play. (Gunn’s nightstick was also in the match, but it appeared to have been broken before it was ever used.)</p>

<p>Moments included Gunn busting Jester open with the barbed wire wrapped “Big Shiny” before Jester took a page out of Abdullah the Butcher’s playbook by bloodying his opponent with the fork, Jester hitting Gunn with an Alabama Slam onto a pile of glass and tacks before Gunn hit him with a Biel throw through the barbed wire table in a corner, and Gunn attacking security guards that were helping Jester before hitting him with a piledriver onto the glass and tacks pile for two. Towards the end, Jester hit Gunn—who attempted to hit him with the barbed wire chair—with a Tombstone onto the glass and tacks for a near fall until Gunn hit him with the Temple Tap, causing Jester to collapse onto the glass and tacks pile for a near fall; then, Gunn placed the barbed wire chair onto the pile and covered it with glass and tacks until Jester hit him with another Tombstone onto that pile and chair for the win. <strong>My score: 4/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-7-sha-samuels-defeated-jackie-polo-w-denise">Match #7: Sha Samuels defeated “Jackie Polo” (w/ Denise).</h2>
<p>DCT taunted the fans until Samuels went after him before the match; the security guards got involved until Samuels hit them and “Polo” with a corkscrew moonsault at ringside. Then, as soon as both competitors got in the ring, Denise slapped Samuels until Samuels hit her with a Michinoku driver; “Polo” went for a low blow until Samuels blocked it seconds before the bell rang. “Polo” used referee Chris Quinn as a shield to block a stinger splash from Samuels, and it allowed K.O.E. to run in and team with “Polo” to beat down Samuels; Denise used the unconscious referee to perform the pin count until Samuels got up at two, and the beatdown continued until all of the sudden, the returning Jaxn came into the ring! Jaxn punched Adam and Marcus King out of the way, then—after Denise got out of the ring—attacked “Polo” before hugging Samuels and handing him DCT’s polo mallet “the hammer”; Samuels hit “Polo” with the mallet and pinned him for the win while standing on top of his opponent in a Jackie Polo pose. <strong>My score: 1/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-8-dylan-thorn-defeated-adm-in-a-last-man-standing-match">Match #8: Dylan Thorn defeated ADM in a Last Man Standing match.</h2>
<p>Before the match started, a messenger came into the ring and praised ADM for being a “savior” and predicting that he would be the last man standing before he introduced Thorn to ADM. Seconds after the match began, the rest of the Manifesto—Grant McIvor, Eddie Castle and Moxie Malone—ran in and Thorn fought them including hitting Moxie with the Crown of Thorns; this allowed ADM to hit Thorn with a chokeslam backbreaker until Thorn got up at eight.</p>

<p>Then, the Young Team (accompanied by the Wee Man) and Angel Hayze appeared and—after Angel hit ADM with a low blow before Thorn dove on everybody with a tope con giro—fought the rest of the Manifesto through the crowd as the Last Man Standing match continued. After ADM countered the Crown of Thorns with an ushigoroshi and Thorn countered a Black Hole Slam with a flatliner, ADM grabbed a chair—with the Manifesto logo on it—from under the ring as did Thorn who found a ladder underneath that squared circle. Both ADM and Thorn fought with the chair and ladder until Thorn hit ADM—who had the chair—with the Crown of Thorns; Thorn got up at nine, and ADM was unable to get up at ten. <strong>My score: 3.5/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-9-theo-doros-defeated-daz-black-to-become-the-new-icw-zero-g-championship">Match #9: Theo Doros defeated Daz Black to become the new ICW Zero-G Championship.</h2>
<p>Doros worked on Black’s left knee as soon as the match began. Doros hit Black with the Fall From Olympus for a near fall, then went for his own curbstomp until Black rolled him up for two; later, Black went for his own Fall From Olympus until Doros shoved referee Sean McLaughlin into the ropes and hit Black with his own curbstomp for a near fall. Doros then had Black in a Figure Four, and Black reversed it until Doros rolled back; unbeknownst to McLaughlin, Doros grabbed the bottom rope for leverage and Black tapped out. After the match, Doros—in an interview by Veronica LeStrange—vowed to save the Zero-G division from “flips” and “garbage” now that he’s the champion. <strong>My score: 2/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="main-event-leyton-buzzard-defeated-the-outlaw-stevie-james-craig-anthony-and-kez-evans-in-a-fatal-four-way-elimination-match-to-become-the-new-icw-world-heavyweight-champion">Main event: Leyton Buzzard defeated “The Outlaw” Stevie James, Craig Anthony and Kez Evans in a fatal four-way elimination match to become the new ICW World Heavyweight Champion.</h2>
<p>Buzzard, whose mother was in attendance, officially cashed in his Square Go! briefcase before the match began. Moments before eliminations occurred include ringside dives such as James’ tope suicida to Evans, Buzzard’s tope con giro to the two, and Anthony’s Swanton to the three; and Evans and Anthony fighting through the crowd until—while James and Buzzard fought back into the ring—Evans threw Anthony off the balcony and into the crowd! James was the first to be eliminated after Evans hit him with an uppercut, brass knuckles and all.</p>

<p>Then, Anthony—who was able to recover—was the next to be eliminated after Evans hit him with a Randy Orton punt followed by a brass knuckles shot to the back of the head. When it all came down to Buzzard and Evans, Evans worked on Buzzard’s left leg after Buzzard tweaked his knee on a failed X Marks the Spot attempt to Anthony. Evans then read Buzzard’s mother the riot act until she threw a cup of beer in his face, leading to Buzzard hitting him with a superkick and X Marks the Spot for a near fall; Evans came back with a low blow and the Kez Dispenser for a near fall, then the Blood Clot Clutch followed by a second Kez Dispenser and a brass knuckles shot for another two. Buzzard dodged another brass knuckles shot and hit him with a low blow of his own, then took the knuckles from Evans and hit him with them before winning with the Buzzkiller. Buzzard celebrated with his mother and everybody else in the audience afterwards. <strong>My score: 4/5</strong></p>

<h1 id="nxt">NXT</h1>

<p>We now head to Orlando, Florida in the United States for an episode of NXT.</p>

<p>We may see a match that could be added to the New Year’s Evil episode of NXT come January 10, 2023. Apollo Crews talked about coming up short in his match with Bron Breakker for the NXT Championship at Deadline, but doesn’t see himself out of championship contention yet. This led to Carmelo Hayes coming into the ring and claims to be next in line while Crews is now in the back of the line; the two then poked fun of each other for not having a title, and then Crews said that no matter how good Hayes thinks he is, there’s always someone better than him such as Crews who then vowed to show him what he was talking about.</p>

<p>I believe that Hayes and Crews will go at it at New Year’s Evil for a shot at the belt; if so, then I predict that—even though it was great seeing Crews and Breakker fighting for the title at Deadline—I believe it will be Hayes’ turn to go after NXT’s brass ring which is of course the NXT Championship. I agree that Crews isn’t out of championship contention yet, and I still want to see him win gold on the white-and-gold brand; Hayes, on the other hand, deserves another belt after seeing him having good runs as the NXT North American Champion.</p>

<p>Last week, we learned that Bron Breakker will defend the NXT Championship against Grayson Waller at New Year’s Evil. This week, Waller wanted to fight Breakker for the belt weeks before the event, searching everywhere in the arena as well as the rest of the WWE Performance Center despite being told—by McKenzie Mitchell in an interview—that Breakker was promoting NXT Vengeance Day in Charlotte, North Carolina. After searching everywhere backstage including places such as the medical facility when Alba Fyre was checked on before her match (as you’ll see in the results shortly), he came into the ring and called out Breakker, wanting the title match; Waller continued to berate Breakker calling him a “gutless champion” until Breakker appeared in the parking lot (in a Dodge Challenger if I remember correctly), and then came into the arena. Breakker hit Waller with a spear…until he ended up unconscious, mainly because Waller revealed that he was wearing a bulletproof vest with a metal plate behind it. This was a good way to buildup New Year’s Evil (as well as wrap up this week’s episode); Waller does make a good arrogant heel, and I liked how he played mind games on not just the champion but everyone else in attendance and at home including doing something that would have Bret Hart and Goldberg grinning ear to ear.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2022-12-27/new day nxt.jpg" alt="new day nxt" class="restrict-width" /></p>

<p>My favorite match of the episode would go to the main event match where we saw the NXT Tag Team Championship on the line; the New Day, WWE’s Triple Crown tag team champions, defended the belts against Josh Briggs &amp; Brooks Jensen this week. It was indeed a great first defense by Xavier Woods and Kofi Kingston on this week’s episode of NXT as both the New Day and Briggs &amp; Jensen had tons of tag team chemistry in this match from start to finish; in the end, it was Woods and Kingston who emerged victorious. Not only do I want to see the New Day continue their tag team title reign on NXT (and they have had amazing tag team title reigns on both Raw and SmackDown as we all know), but I would also like to see them kill two birds with one stone just like Dolph Ziggler back when he was the NXT Champion and fighting on both NXT and Raw. As for Briggs &amp; Jensen, they still continue to be impressive in the tag team division and I see that those two—like Apollo Crews—aren’t out of championship contention yet even if they’re in a storyline where Fallon Henley has her hands full with Kiana James per se.</p>

<p>Here are the NXT results from Orlando…</p>

<h2 id="match-1-carmelo-hayes-w-trick-williams-defeated-axiom-both-hayes-and-axiom-were-in-a-test-of-strength-knuckle-lock-and-the-two-climbed-to-the-top-rope-where-axiom-hit-him-with-hurricanrana">Match #1: Carmelo Hayes (w/ Trick Williams) defeated Axiom. Both Hayes and Axiom were in a test of strength knuckle lock, and the two climbed to the top rope where Axiom hit him with hurricanrana.</h2>
<p>Then, behind the referee’s back, Williams yanked Axiom to the mat before Hayes hit him with a Codebreaker followed by the Nothing But Net for the win. After the match, Axiom hit Williams with a moonsault at ringside. <strong>My score: 3.25/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-2-zoey-stark-defeated-nikkita-lyons">Match #2: Zoey Stark defeated Nikkita Lyons.</h2>
<p>Zoey attempted to blindside Nikkita at the entryway until Nikkita, as if she had eyes in the back of her head, dodged her and fought her to the ring. After Nikkita hit Zoey with a Samoan drop for two followed by a superkick, both wrestlers traded rollups until Zoey grabbed the ropes while pinning her for the win. <strong>My score: 0.5/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-3-kayden-carter--katana-chance-defeated-toxic-attraction-and-tatum-paxley--ivy-nile-in-a-triple-threat-tag-team-match-to-retain-the-nxt-womens-tag-team-championship">Match #3: Kayden Carter &amp; Katana Chance defeated Toxic Attraction and Tatum Paxley &amp; Ivy Nile in a triple threat tag team match to retain the NXT Women’s Tag Team Championship.</h2>
<p>Mandy Rose is no longer part of Toxic Attraction because she was released from the WWE hours after losing the NXT Women’s Championship to Roxanne Perez. After all six wrestlers took each other down with superkicks, Tatum fought Kayden on the top rope until Katana tagged in and took her off of Kayden with a hurricanrana before Ivy broke up the pin. Then, after Ivy tagged in, Kayden and Katana went for a 450/neckbreaker combo until Tatum pushed Katana off the top rope and into Gigi Dolin and Jacy Jayne at ringside; this allowed Ivy to put Kayden in the DCL until Kayden bounced off the ropes and turned it into a jackknife pin for the win. <strong>My score: 3.5/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-4-elektra-lopez-defeated-indi-hartwell-in-three-and-a-half-minutes">Match #4: Elektra Lopez defeated Indi Hartwell in three and a half minutes.</h2>
<p>Elektra pulled brass knuckles from a top turnbuckle pad and, while Indi went for a back suplex, hit her with them to score the win. <strong>My score: 0.5/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-5-sol-ruca-vs-alba-fyre-never-took-place-at-all">Match #5: Sol Ruca vs. Alba Fyre never took place at all.</h2>
<p>Earlier in the episode, Alba was heading to the ring until Isla Dawn blew red powder in her face. After being checked and released, Alba got to the ring until Isla reappeared and yanked her off the apron; Isla then trapped Alba’s right hand in the steel steps and hit the steps with Alba’s bat before leaving. <strong>No score.</strong></p>

<h2 id="main-event-the-new-day-defeated-josh-briggs--brooks-jensen-w-fallon-henley-to-retain-the-nxt-tag-team-championship">Main event: The New Day defeated Josh Briggs &amp; Brooks Jensen (w/ Fallon Henley) to retain the NXT Tag Team Championship.</h2>
<p>Kiana James and her assistant Giovanna watched the match in the audience. After Briggs cleaned house on both Xavier Woods and Kofi Kingston at ringside, he and Jensen hit Kingston with an inverted atomic drop/big boot combo for two, then Briggs surprised Kingston with a moonsault for another two. Woods ran in and knocked Jensen off the top rope and to the announce table, then Kingston hit Briggs with the Trouble In Paradise before hitting Jensen with a tope suicida; then, Woods—who tagged in before Kingston’s tope—hit Briggs with a tightrope elbow drop for the win. Both teams and Fallon shook hands afterwards. <strong>My score: 4.5/5</strong></p>

<h1 id="nxt-lvl-up">NXT: LVL UP</h1>

<p>Staying in Orlando, we wrap things up with an episode of NXT: LVL UP.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2022-12-27/nxt lvl up charlie dempsey.jpg" alt="charlie dempsey" class="restrict-width" /></p>

<p>My favorite match of the episode was the opener, and it definitely kicked off this week’s episode with a bang. In the match were Charlie Dempsey and Myles Borne; Borne was looking to shake off his losing streak while searching for another win in this match while Dempsey continued to have a strong showing with technical submission maneuvers that slowing his opponent down a handful of times. Dempsey, who ended up victorious, has been doing great in the WWE—as well as the indies including Progress—from his time on NXT UK to moving to the United States to compete on NXT; also, he is indeed a splitting image of his father William Regal fighting ability wise and not just person wise.</p>

<p>Here are the NXT: LVL UP results from Orlando…</p>

<h2 id="match-1-charlie-dempsey-defeated-myles-borne">Match #1: Charlie Dempsey defeated Myles Borne.</h2>
<p>Dempsey worked on one of Borne’s arms during the match. Borne came back with a suplex and a back body drop, but missed on a top rope crossbody attempt; this allowed Dempsey to hit him with a Regalplex for the win. <strong>My score: 3.5/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="match-2-sol-ruca-defeated-dani-palmer-in-three-minutes">Match #2: Sol Ruca defeated Dani Palmer in three minutes.</h2>
<p>After both exchanged pin attempts for back-to-back two counts, Sol hit Dani with a dropkick followed by a backflip from the middle rope into a cutter (now known as the Sol Snatcher) for the win. <strong>My score: 1/5</strong></p>

<h2 id="main-event-trick-williams-defeated-hank-walker">Main event: Trick Williams defeated Hank Walker.</h2>
<p>After Walker hit Williams with a powerslam for two, Williams came back with a swinging neckbreaker for two followed by the Trick Kick for the win. <strong>My score: 3/5</strong></p>

<h1 id="next-time">Next time…</h1>
