&lt;h2 id=&quot;moving-on&quot;&gt;Moving on…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2022-03-26/samantha irvin.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;samantha irvin&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck wishes go out to Samantha Irvin who is now the official ring announcer of SmackDown! She was best known for her time as the ring announcer, as well as occasional backstage interviewer, on both NXT and 205 Live. I’m hoping that she does well on SmackDown now that Mike Rome is focusing on just Raw after taking over for the released Greg Hamilton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From moving on to the next chapter to get well wishes. There was a reason why last week’s episode of 205 Live had only two matches; Odyssey Jones was competing in what would have been a 205 Live match before he suffered a leg injury during the taping; get well wishes go out to Odyssey, and we hope to see you again real soon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onto the newsletter…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;icw-fight-club&quot;&gt;ICW Fight Club&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First stop, Glasgow for this week’s episode of ICW Fight Club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daz Black does indeed prove to be a fighting champion, even if his match was a non-title bout this week. You can tell that he is prepared for Square Go! when he defends the ICW Zero-G championship against the Manifesto’s Dylan Thorn. Plus, he noted that he’s no stranger to being outnumbered by one or more managers at ringside such as Thatcher Wright when members of his “Cabinet” are in action, and the same going for ADM and his cohorts when anyone from the Manifesto fights him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of outnumbered, we’re getting good buildups on current rivalries that ICW has. One is Thatcher’s Cabinet against the reunited team of Lou King Sharp and Krieger, and another is—come Square Go!—Angel Hayze and She-Wolves member Kasey for the ICW Women’s championship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The build for the 30-man Square Go! match is going strong as well; while WWE continues to have male and female superstars throwing their names in both Royal Rumble matches, so are the men—with the latest being LJ Cleary as we saw this week (alongside—unless you don’t keep score at home—Andy Wild, Big Damo, Luke Kyro, Leyton Buzzard, and Jack Jester) in ICW’s upcoming Square Go! match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have one ongoing feud between the now-heel ICW Tag Team champions Kings of the North (Bonesaw &amp;amp; Corvin) and the now-face Nine9 (Dickie Divers and Jack Morris); the Nine9 is looking forward to fighting the champions for those titles at Square Go! ever since Divers got KO’d at Fear &amp;amp; Loathing XIII before the Kings of the North beat down Morris for the gold while EMTs, staff members, and wrestlers checked on Divers that night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From one moment where competitors tried to keep their emotions in check to another, the main event did indeed have Wolfgang beside himself—as well as ticked off—after seeing his cousin BT Gunn get injured by Kez Evans in the first Fight Club episode of 2022 even when both Evans and Wolfgang brought a chair and brass knuckles into play. Good to see Wolfgang take his frustrations out on Evans in the storyline that was part of the ICW World heavyweight championship bout in that episode. Plus, as usual, Evans (who plays a pretty damn good heel, regardless of how much he goes “too far” his character goes) became his dastardly self as he used both of the weapons—including the brass knuckles that Wolfgang brought in—to take the easy way out when it comes to retaining the title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the match results for the 204th episode of ICW Fight Club…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-1-daz-black-defeated-mr-charles-vyce-w-thatcher-wright-in-a-non-title-match&quot;&gt;Match #1: Daz Black defeated Mr. Charles Vyce (w/ Thatcher Wright) in a non-title match;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thatcher interfered near the end until Lou King Sharp appeared and fought him into the crowd, leading to Black making a comeback and defeating Vyce with the Blackout (Seth Rollins’ stomp). &lt;strong&gt;My score: 3/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-2-sinergy-defeated-ross-hunter--robbie-balfour-in-a-few-minutes-with-the-sinergizer-wheelbarrow-slamtop-rope-bulldog-combo&quot;&gt;Match #2: Sinergy defeated Ross Hunter &amp;amp; Robbie Balfour in a few minutes with the Sinergizer (wheelbarrow slam/top rope bulldog combo);&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the debut match for Anderson Daniels and Troy Ryan, who are also eyeing on the Kings of the North especially for tag team gold. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 2/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-3-ellie-armstrong-defeated-moxie-malone-with-the-plant-bomb-vader-bomb-like-spinning-senton-bomb&quot;&gt;Match #3: Ellie Armstrong defeated Moxie Malone with the Plant Bomb (Vader Bomb-like spinning senton bomb).&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My score: 3/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;main-event-kez-evans-defeated-wolfgang-to-retain-the-icw-world-heavyweight-championship&quot;&gt;Main event: Kez Evans defeated Wolfgang to retain the ICW World heavyweight championship;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…after two Kez Dispensers for two near falls and Wolfgang’s Route 666 spear for a near fall, Evans used his opponent’s brass knuckles before incapacitating him with the Blood Clot Clutch. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 3/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nxt&quot;&gt;NXT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off to Orlando, where Diamond Mine had an up and down night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ups first, the Creed Brothers defeating Josh Briggs and Brooks Jensen to advance to the next round in the 2022 Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic; Brutus and Julius were able to shake off a crazy start where Jensen kneed Brutus in the face so hard, his mouthpiece literally flew out of his mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other up that Diamond Mine had saw Ivy Nile keeping her undefeated streak alive by defeating the former NXT UK Women’s champion Kay Lee Ray, courtesy of Mandy Rose whose photoshoot set she destroyed last week on an episode of NXT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2022-03-26/walter roderick.webp&quot; alt=&quot;walter roderick strong&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only down that Diamond Mine experienced that night was Roderick Strong losing to Walter, even though it was still my favorite match of the episode per se. Post-match, Fabian Aichner and Marcel Barthel ran in and the three members of Imperium beat down Strong until the Creed Brothers ran in and all six men got into—pun intended—a pier six brawl in the ring as this week’s episode of NXT went off the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brawl occurred as something that I didn’t expect involving a former NXT United Kingdom champion regardless of what has been going on in the multicolored brand nowadays…Walter interrupted ring announcer Alicia Taylor and said “The winner of this match is Gunther!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yep, you read correctly…Walter is now Gunther. I’m not a big fan of that name change anyway, and neither are those that looked up the new name on Google as soon as he announced it. He will always be Walter to me regardless of the name change, even after in the last newsletter I rated his match with Cara Noir that took place at wXw Anniversary XXI five out of five.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, name changes aside, now that Imperium is competing in the United States and especially the multicolored NXT brand more often, it looks like that Imperium’s first feud as a trio will start off with the three male members of Diamond Mine. This rivalry could get interesting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of rivalries, we saw a rivalry renewed last week as L.A. Knight returned to NXT for unfinished business with Grayson Waller. Waller currently has a restraining order, keeping Knight 50 feet away from him or else Knight is arrested automatically. I predict that those two will finally clash, minus the restraining order, at the next NXT TakeOver…I mean, premium live event. (P.S.: Those NXT live events are still takeovers to me regardless of how much has changed in the WWE.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also enjoying the aforementioned feud between Kay Lee Ray and Mandy Rose, even if you add the rest of Toxic Attraction—Gigi Dolin and Jacy Jayne—and Indi Hartwell and Persia Pirotta to the mix. I’m curious to see how their six-woman tag team match will go on next week’s episodes now that they’re eyeing on all three titles—NXT Women’s championship and NXT Women’s Tag Team championship—that Toxic Attraction is carrying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From championships to tournaments, the Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic was off to a pretty good start, even with a big upset that wrapped up the first half of the quarterfinals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the Creed Brothers advancing, Malik Blade and Edris Enofé moved on to the next round in a big upset after defeating Joaquin Wilde and Raul Mendoza; this upset would occur after Bron Breakker went after his possible challenger for the NXT championship Santos Escobar. Now, I’m chomping into bit on the women’s DRTTC come February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of challengers, I’m curious to see who the challenger for the NXT North American championship will be after Cameron Grimes vs. Tony D’Angelo next week; I’m leaning towards Grimes in my prediction regardless of how well the 2.0 newcomers have been performing lately. (P.S.: I wasn’t really a big fan of the funeral Tony held for Pete Dunne’s NXT career; I got a feeling that Dunne isn’t done with D’Angelo yet.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those rivalries appear to be buildups to a possible NXT premium live event come, as I predict, next month or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the results for this week’s episode of NXT…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-1-grayson-waller-defeated-dexter-lumis-with-his-through-the-ropes-cutter-finisher&quot;&gt;Match #1: Grayson Waller defeated Dexter Lumis with his through-the-ropes cutter finisher;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to the match being made, Waller had a catch-22, which was to either fight Lumis or drop the restraining order and fight L.A. Knight. Near the end, Saurav—in a suit—appeared and attack Lumis, leading to Waller defeating him. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 3.25/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-2-the-creed-brothers-w-malcolm-bivens-defeated-josh-briggs--brooks-jensen&quot;&gt;Match #2: The Creed Brothers (w/ Malcolm Bivens) defeated Josh Briggs &amp;amp; Brooks Jensen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…in the quarterfinal round of the DRTTC after the Creed Brothers hit Briggs with a torture rack slam/basement clothesline combo. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 2.5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-3-dante-chan-vs-guru-raaj-ended-in-a-double-dq&quot;&gt;Match #3: Dante Chan vs. Guru Raaj ended in a double DQ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…due to interference by Duke Hudson who came from the crowd and attacked the two; disappointing way to end Chan’s return from injury and his father’s passing during recovery. &lt;strong&gt;No score.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-4-ivy-nile-w-malcolm-bivens-defeated-kay-lee-ray&quot;&gt;Match #4: Ivy Nile (w/ Malcolm Bivens) defeated Kay Lee Ray&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…after countering the KLR Bomb with a rollup when Ray was distracted by Mandy Rose. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 1.5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-5-malik-blade--edris-enofé-defeated-joaquin-wilde--raul-mendoza-w-santos-escobar-and-elektra-lopez&quot;&gt;Match #5: Malik Blade &amp;amp; Edris Enofé defeated Joaquin Wilde &amp;amp; Raul Mendoza (w/ Santos Escobar and Elektra Lopez)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the quarterfinal round of the DRTTC after Blade rolled up Wilde—distracted by Bron Breakker—for the win. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 1.5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-6-dakota-kai-defeated-yulisa-leon-w-valentina-feroz&quot;&gt;Match #6: Dakota Kai defeated Yulisa Leon (w/ Valentina Feroz)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with her running corner kick finisher; post-match, Dakota attacked Valentina until Yulisa rescued her. This match was made after Dakota has been poking fun of friendships backstage including Yulisa and Valentina’s friendship. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 2/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;main-event-walter-defeated-roderick-strong-w-malcolm-bivens-with-a-powerbomb&quot;&gt;Main event: Walter defeated Roderick Strong (w/ Malcolm Bivens) with a powerbomb.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My score: 4/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nxt-uk&quot;&gt;NXT UK&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile in London, three feuds are heating up even with matches in coming weeks…Meiko Satomura vs. Blair Davenport in a possible rematch for the NXT UK Women’s championship, Die Familie vs. Gallus in six-man tag team action, and—for the NXT United Kingdom championship—Ilja Dragunov vs. Jordan Devlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sam Gradwell is slowing becoming a babyface, even after finally being able to find a tag team partner for his match against Pretty Deadly this week; footage from early in the week showing Gradwell looking for a tag team partner—in the WWE Performance Center in the UK, a room service phone call, a fast-food drive thru, etc.—did give me a good laugh. It was no laughing matter unfortunately as Kenny Williams, whom Sam grabbed by the ear and berated after Kenny mocked him for searching for a tag team partner, rained on his parade near the end of the opening match of the episode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2022-03-26/noam dar hetigate cup.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;noam dar&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main event for the NXT UK Heritage Cup was good, even though it would have been nice to see the match go into sudden death like in the inaugural Heritage Cup match from a couple years ago. On the other hand, the Rolling Stones have told us for years that “you can’t always get what you want.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the results of the matches that occurred at the BT Sports Studios…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-1-pretty-deadly-defeated-sam-gradwell--saxon-huxley&quot;&gt;Match #1: Pretty Deadly defeated Sam Gradwell &amp;amp; Saxon Huxley;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end, Kenny Williams snuck at ringside and beat down Huxley, prior to Lewis Howley and Sam Stoker defeating Gradwell with Spilled Milk. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 2.5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-2-isla-dawn-defeated-emilia-mckenzie-with-an-f5-like-stunner&quot;&gt;Match #2: Isla Dawn defeated Emilia McKenzie with an F5-like Stunner;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post-match, Isla gave Emilia back her wristwatch (stolen—along with a lock of Dani Luna’s hair, Aleah James’ scrunchie, etc.—back in the summer of last year). &lt;strong&gt;My score: 2.5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;main-event-a-kid-vs-noam-dar-w-sha-samuels-for-the-nxt-uk-heritage-cup&quot;&gt;Main event: A-Kid vs. Noam Dar (w/ Sha Samuels) for the NXT UK Heritage Cup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…ended in a draw 1-1; Dar took the 1-0 lead in round 3 via Nova Roller, A-Kid tied it up in round 4 with an armdrag/springboard DDT combo (that knocked Samuels off the apron), and the final round ended with A-Kid unable to make Dar submit to the omoplata, leading to Dar retaining the Heritage Cup. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 2.75/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;205-live&quot;&gt;205 Live&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing really much to talk about; I’ve seen better episodes of 205 Live, besides those that originally had nothing but cruiserweights. Here’s what happened in Orlando…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-1-lash-legend-defeated-fallon-henley-by-submission-with-a-curved-torture-rack&quot;&gt;Match #1: Lash Legend defeated Fallon Henley by submission with a curved torture rack,&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;similar to how Ivy Nile won in her first NXT match. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 1.5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-2-draco-anthony-defeated-javier-bernal-with-a-running-leg-lariat&quot;&gt;Match #2: Draco Anthony defeated Javier Bernal with a running leg lariat.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My score: 1.5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;main-event-james-drake-w-zack-gibson-defeated-bodhi-hayward-w-andre-chase&quot;&gt;Main event: James Drake (w/ Zack Gibson) defeated Bodhi Hayward (w/ Andre Chase)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with a running dropkick in the corner after Gibson interfered; both Chase &amp;amp; Hayward and the Grizzled Young Veterans will fight in the quarterfinals in the DRTTC on the next episode of NXT. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 1/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until then…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading! I’ll see you next time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, thanks for the comments on my newsletter! I really appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-a-coincidence&quot;&gt;What a coincidence!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t really have much to say for the intro in this newsletter, except that it’s a coincidence that I’m doing—like in the last one—four shows in the fourth newsletter.
Okay, I’m done with confusing readers, numerology and corny jokes (or “dad jokes” as we nowadays call them)…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;let’s get to the newsletter, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;icw-fight-club&quot;&gt;ICW Fight Club&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The episode took place inside an empty Glasgow Pro Wrestling Asylum; there was no fans because of, sadly, a COVID outbreak that occurred in Scotland. However, ICW still has Square Go! as scheduled despite the company making select empty arena episodes of ICW Fight Club starting with this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the current storylines outside those involving championships and the upcoming Square Go! is DCT’s rivalry with the currently absent Jaxn, and then portraying as Jaxn’s former alter ego “Jackie Polo.” Not only is he the thorn on Jaxn’s side, but also on Luke Kyro’s side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as I’m not a big fan of current “talk shows” that occur in pro wrestling such as Noam Dar’s Supernova Sessions on NXT UK or Lash Legend’s Lashing Out on NXT, Luke Kyro’s Vibes—regardless of how new his show is—has grown on me. Unless all hell breaks loose like many “talk shows” do, Vibes is definitely fun to watch when it comes to checking out segments like this in independent pro wrestling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to his rivalry with “Jackie Polo”, Kyro was supposed to go face-to-face with him this week on ICW Fight Club. However, “Polo” didn’t fight him this week because a contract for that matchup “wasn’t completed in time”; as a result, the replacement for “Polo” was Caleb Valhalla, whom Kyro was able to defeat despite size vs. strength coming into play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if they’re going to have a match on either a later episode of ICW Fight Club or at Square Go! as that rivalry, with or without Jaxn, rolls on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2022-03-26/lizzy evo angel hayze.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Lizzy Evo Angel Hayze&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also rolling along is Angel Hayze’s run as the ICW Women’s champion. She had an excellent non-title match this week with Lizzy Evo, whom we have also seen on Progress last year participating in the Revelations of Divine Rose tournament (where the winner becomes the #1 contender for the Progress Women’s championship).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lizzy had a strong showing in her matchup, even if Angel came out as the victor. I look forward to seeing more of Lizzy in competition, whether it’s on Progress, ICW, or another European indie show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the match results from Glasgow…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-1-the-nine9-defeated-woke-academy-in-a-few-minutes-with-the-nikolai-driver&quot;&gt;Match #1: The Nine9 defeated Woke Academy in a few minutes with the Nikolai Driver;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in case you don’t know who the Woke Academy are, it’s the team of Robbie Balfour and Ross Hunter whom we have seen lately. &lt;strong&gt;No score.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-2-aaron-echo-defeated-mikey-divine-w-rabu-romero&quot;&gt;Match #2: Aaron Echo defeated Mikey Divine (w/ Rabu Romero)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with a pumphandle fallaway slam; post-match, Echo attacked both Divine and Romero before throwing them out of the ring and announcing that he’s entering the Square Go! match. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 1.75/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-3-angel-hayze-defeated-lizzy-evo-with-a-code-red-like-faceplant-in-a-non-title-match&quot;&gt;Match #3: Angel Hayze defeated Lizzy Evo with a Code Red-like faceplant in a non-title match;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;both women shook hands afterwards. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 4.25/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;##Match #4: Logan Smith defeated Ian Skinner (w/ Thatcher Wright and Charles Vyce). 
Near the end, Vyce tripped Smith from ringside before being sent to the back. Then, Thatcher attempted to help Skinner until Lou King Sharp appeared and attacked Thatcher with a kendo stick before chasing him away, leading to Smith defeating Skinner with a running spinning neckbreaker. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 3/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;main-event-luke-kyro-defeated-caleb-valhalla-w-jackie-polo-with-the-kyroscope&quot;&gt;Main event: Luke Kyro defeated Caleb Valhalla (w/ “Jackie Polo”) with the Kyroscope.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My score: 3.5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nxt&quot;&gt;NXT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the Glasgow Pro Wrestling Asylum to the arena that’s no longer named the Capitol Wrestling Center in Orlando we go…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2022-03-24/MSK.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;Dusty Cup 2022&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic is still going strong, especially with an excellent opener that kicked off the second half of the quarterfinal round. I would have been happy with either result of MSK vs. Jacket Time…Ikemen Jiro and Kushida dethroning Wes Lee and Nash Carter like the Los Angeles Rams did to last year’s Super Bowl champions the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the playoffs this weekend, or MSK becoming the first team to win back-to-back DRTTC tournaments. In the end, it was MSK being victorious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also victorious in the quarterfinal round was the inaugural NXT UK Tag Team champions Grizzled Young Veterans over Andre Chase &amp;amp; Bodhi Hayward. I kind of expected the team of Zack Gibson and James Drake to keep moving forward, even if they’re no strangers to competing in the DRTTC tournament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we have four teams getting ready to go at it in the semi-final round…MSK, Edris Enofé &amp;amp; Malik Blade, the Creed Brothers, and Grizzled Young Veterans. In addition, we learned that the final round of that tournament will take place at NXT Vengeance Day which is no longer what WWE nowadays calls a “premium live event” (f.k.a. Pay-Per-Views and NXT TakeOvers to be more specific); it is nowadays like New Year’s Evil and Halloween Havoc, meaning that it will be a special NXT episode come the day after Valentine’s Day. (Speaking of tournaments, I’m curious to see what teams will take part of the women’s DRTTC tournament come February since we didn’t see the brackets for it yet.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From tournaments to championships, it appears that Santos Escobar will be the next challenger for the NXT championship, currently held by Bron Breakker. This week, we saw that Legado del Fantasma attempted to outnumber the champion until Breakker was able to outsmart Joaquin Wilde and Raul Mendoza by beating the two down in the ring. Then, as soon as the episode was coming to a close, the three men in Legado attempted to play the numbers game again until they retreated as soon as the previous NXT champion Tommaso Ciampa appeared! Looks like we may see Ciampa and Breakker take on Escobar, Wilde, and Mendoza (with Elektra Lopez in tow) in 2-on-3 action next week, and probably the NXT championship on the line come February 15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I honestly think that we’re going to see all of NXT’s titles on the line at NXT Vengeance Day; besides the NXT championship, it looks like we’ll also see Indi Hartwell &amp;amp; Persia Pirotta take on Gigi Dolin and Jacy Jayne for the NXT Women’s Tag Team championship, ditto Kay Lee Ray fighting Mandy Rose for the NXT Women’s title. I think of those match predictions because of their six-woman tag team match that occurred this past Tuesday; it appears that the three have been eyeing on Toxic Attraction for the titles around their waist, especially the idea of KLR vs. Mandy ever since Mandy distracted her in her match against Ivy Nile last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only title I didn’t mention was the NXT North American title because we all saw that Cameron Grimes, after defeating Tony D’Angelo in the main event this week, will fight Carmelo Hayes for that title at NXT Vengeance Day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting what matches should take place in February aside, not only did I like the opening match as well as the closer and the six-woman tag team match, but I also liked the No Disqualification/Falls Count Anywhere match between Solo Sikoa and Boa (unless hardcore/extreme rules matches aren’t your cup of tea). Good to see Sikoa continuing his undefeated streak on NXT, even after going toe-to-toe with the power-possessed Boa in and outside the ring (as well as in and outside the venue, damaged grate and all).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the match results…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-1-msk-defeated-jacket-time-in-the-quarterfinal-round-of-the-drttc&quot;&gt;Match #1: MSK defeated Jacket Time in the quarterfinal round of the DRTTC;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kushida went for the Hoverboard Lock until it was blocked, leading to Wes Lee and Nash Carter defeating him with a spinebuster/top rope blockbuster combo. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 4.5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-2-solo-sikoa-defeated-boa-in-a-no-disqualificationfalls-count-anywhere-match&quot;&gt;Match #2: Solo Sikoa defeated Boa in a No Disqualification/Falls Count Anywhere match&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;after Sikoa hit Boa with a top rope splash through the table at ringside. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 3/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-3-duke-hudson-defeated-guru-raaj-with-a-crucifix-powerbomb&quot;&gt;Match #3: Duke Hudson defeated Guru Raaj with a crucifix powerbomb;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, Dante Chen ran in and fought Hudson until—while the referees were separating the two—Hudson hit Chen with a chop block to the previously injured leg. &lt;strong&gt;No score.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-4-kay-lee-ray-indi-hartwell--persia-pirotta-defeated-toxic-attraction&quot;&gt;Match #4: Kay Lee Ray, Indi Hartwell &amp;amp; Persia Pirotta defeated Toxic Attraction;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end, KLR chased Mandy to the back with her baseball bat while—back in the ring—Persia defeated Gigi Dolin with a spinning sitout faceplant. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 2.75/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-5-grizzled-young-veterans-defeated-andre-chase--bodhi-hayward-in-the-quarterfinal-round-of-the-drttc&quot;&gt;Match #5: Grizzled Young Veterans defeated Andre Chase &amp;amp; Bodhi Hayward in the quarterfinal round of the DRTTC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…after Zack Gibson and James Drake hit Hayward with a double Codebreaker; after the match, Von Wagner (with Robert Stone who lifted his suspension and paid his fine as we learned) ran in and attacked Chase and Hayward. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 1.75/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-6-io-shirai-defeated-tiffany-stratton-with-a-bodyslam-followed-by-a-moonsault&quot;&gt;Match #6: Io Shirai defeated Tiffany Stratton with a bodyslam followed by a moonsault.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My score: 1.5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;main-event-cameron-grimes-defeated-tony-dangelo-to-become-the-1-contender-for-the-nxt-north-american-championship&quot;&gt;Main event: Cameron Grimes defeated Tony D’Angelo to become the #1 contender for the NXT North American championship;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end, as Tony was taking a breather, Pete Dunne—equipped with a cricket bat—scared him back into the ring, leading to Grimes defeating him with the Cave In. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 3.75/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nxt-uk&quot;&gt;NXT UK&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was no disqualification/falls count anywhere week in the NXT Universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only did we see that type of matchup between Solo Sikoa and Boa on NXT in Orlando, but Ilja Dragunov and Jordan Devlin ended up competing in one this week with the NXT United Kingdom championship on the line. Only this time, it was an Empty Arena match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That match went all over the place (pun intended), from in the ring where Devlin struck Dragunov with a headbutt prior to the bell being rung, to the empty crowd as soon as Dragunov crashed Devlin through the barricade prior to crashing through a table due to a failed Torpedo Moscow attempt, and then back in the ring where Dragunov put Devlin through a table—after blocking Devlin’s Devlin Side attempt through the table—with a Death Valley driver for a near fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looked like we would see “The Irish Ace” crowned as the new champion due to Dragunov’s eye injury from the pre-match headbutt as well as Devlin using zip ties to put his opponent’s hands behind his back until Dragunov made him say otherwise by kicking him away before defeating him with a Torpedo Moscow-like headbutt to retain the title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of both no DQ/FCA matches that occurred this week, Dragunov vs. Devlin was slightly better than the one that occurred in Orlando.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of no DQ/FCA, I’m definitely excited to see the rematch between Meiko Satomura and Blair Davenport for the NXT UK Women’s championship; we learned on NXT UK this week, that their rematch will be a Japanese Street Fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2022-03-24/NXTUK 4.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;Gallus&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the opener between Die Familie and Gallus, regardless of how much the trio of Teoman, Rohan Raja and Charlie Dempsey had up in their sleeves while fighting the trio of Mark and Joe Coffey and Wolfgang. It could have gone either way, a Gallus win or a Die Familie win. Plus, it was noted by the commentators—Andy Shepherd and Nigel McGuinness—that it was two down and one to go for Dempsey making Gallus members lose to him; Dempsey defeated Joe Coffey in the past and then made Wolfgang submit, and he has yet to clash with Mark Coffey in another matchup (one-on-one, tag team, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the results of the matches that occurred in London…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-1-die-familie-defeated-gallus&quot;&gt;Match #1: Die Familie defeated Gallus;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end, Mark Coffey and Wolfgang attempted to double team Dempsey until Rohan Raja pulled Mark out of the ring while Teoman ran in and chop blocked Wolfgang, leading to Dempsey making Wolfgang submit to a modified STF. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 3.75/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-2-jinny-defeated-amale&quot;&gt;Match #2: Jinny defeated Amale;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amale went for the Hope Breaker until Jinny blocked it before taking her down and, using the ropes for leverage, pinned her for the win. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 1.5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;main-event-ilja-dragunov-defeated-jordan-devlin-in-an-empty-arena-match&quot;&gt;Main event: Ilja Dragunov defeated Jordan Devlin in an Empty Arena match&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to retain the NXT United Kingdom championship with a Torpedo Moscow-like headbutt while his hands were still zip tied behind his back. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 3.5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;205-live&quot;&gt;205 Live&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we return to Orlando for Evolve…I mean, 205 Live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before getting to the matches, good luck wishes go out to Sudu Shah who is a new addition to WWE; he worked with Nigel McGuinness at the announce table on this week’s episode.
Onto the matches which were, like last week’s 205 Live matches, so-so…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-1-josh-briggs-w-brooks-jensen-defeated-damon-kemp-with-a-clothesline-from-hell-ala-jbl&quot;&gt;Match #1: Josh Briggs (w/ Brooks Jensen) defeated Damon Kemp with a Clothesline From Hell (ala JBL);&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briggs stopped Jensen from attempting to interfere during the match. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 1.5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-2-yulisa-leon--valentina-feroz-defeated-amari-miller--lash-legend&quot;&gt;Match #2: Yulisa Leon &amp;amp; Valentina Feroz defeated Amari Miller &amp;amp; Lash Legend.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This match was mostly tainted by miscommunications and arguments by the team of Amari and Lash; the two argued near the end of the match until Yulisa rolled up Amari and pinned her for the win. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 1.25/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;main-event-joe-gacy-w-harland-defeated-draco-anthony-with-a-handspring-clothesline&quot;&gt;Main event: Joe Gacy (w/ Harland) defeated Draco Anthony with a handspring clothesline.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My score: 1.5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-time&quot;&gt;Next time…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two words…Royal Rumble. That’s what kicks off the next newsletter along with the usual ICW and WWE shows of my choosing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, Royal Rumble isn’t the only thing that I’m kicking off the next newsletter with. I’m also adding a look back at the first Progress chapter of 2022! Yes, I’m starting off the next newsletter with a one-two punch of special events…one from WWE and one from Progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading! I’ll see you next time!&lt;/p&gt;
