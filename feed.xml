&lt;p&gt;Unless your name is Vince McMahon, tag team wrestling has always held a special place in your
heart. Sure, the singles division is what drives most wrestling companies, but the tag team division has
provided just as many memorable moments and great matches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tag teams can show some tremendous charisma and become one of the best parts of the
roster. They are a great way to showcase younger talent and build experience in the greener athletes on
the roster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as we all love tag teams it is inevitable that they will break up, but how and when can
determine their success. There have been teams that have broken up much too soon while others
needed to get the axe earlier. Below let's take a look at some such examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;too-soon-enzo-and-cass&quot;&gt;Too Soon: Enzo and Cass&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The loudmouth tandem from New York was incredibly popular in WWE. Starting in NXT their
schtick was fantastic. They had the right hook for their entrance to get the fans going and their ability to
verbally spar with anyone was perfect. It was reminiscent of The New Age Outlaws for their ability to rile
up the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once on the main roster, this popularity grew. They were getting massive pops from the crowd
and many thought it was only a matter of time before they won the tag titles. Unfortunately, WWE
pulled the trigger on a break-up way too soon. The tag team had tons of legs left and they could have
dominated the ranks for at least another year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-soon-enough-demolition&quot;&gt;Not Soon Enough: Demolition&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working off the success of The Road Warriors, Demolition became one of the most dominant
tag teams in WWE history. They beat every team there was to beat and were the longest-reigning
champions in the company for over two decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demolition will always be Ax and Smash. When it was clear that this wasn’t going to be a viable
option anymore Crush was added to the group. It was a mistake to do this. It showed that the team was
too old to continue. Why not just keep the aura around the team intact and end them when it was
necessary? Holding on for too long was a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;too-soon-american-alpha&quot;&gt;Too Soon: American Alpha&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American Alpha were rock stars on NXT. They were incredibly over and would consistently steal
whichever card they were a part of. This success continued, albeit shortly, once they made it to the main
roster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan and Gable were cornerstones of the Smackdown Live tag division. They were at the top
of their game, bringing their talent to a larger audience. Injuries slowed the team down but 
the over-correction of splitting them up was misguided. This could have been the team to carry 
the division and bring legitimacy back to the tag team ranks in WWE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-soon-enough-rhythm-and-blues&quot;&gt;Not Soon Enough: Rhythm and Blues&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because two men have nothing to do doesn’t mean they should be put into a tag team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honky Tonk Man and Greg Valentine were two such men. They had long past their spots on the mid-
card and were mainly used as jobbers to up-and-comers. Hence they get thrown into a tag team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a ridiculous notion and one that didn’t work. It was a joke and got the wrong laughs from
the crowd. Either man should have been given anything else to do other than this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They lost more than they won and it seemed pointless to throw them together in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;too-soon-allied-powers&quot;&gt;Too Soon: Allied Powers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this is how two successful single wrestlers can form a great tag team. Both Luger and
Bulldog had come off great singles runs, but the division was getting full. Putting them together instantly
gave us a credible tag team in a division short on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their initial matchup against the Blu Brothers was a good way to introduce the team and it led
straight into a program against the tag team champions. Facing Owen Hart and Yokozuna gave us some
good matches and it was hoped that Luger and Bulldog would win the straps. Rather the team was
disbanded shortly after robbing us of a deserved longer run for The Allied Powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-soon-enough-the-hart-foundation&quot;&gt;Not Soon Enough: The Hart Foundation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, the Hart Foundation was an all-time great tag team. They were at the top of the division
during the Golden Age of tag team wrestling, but that still doesn’t give them a pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bret Hart was the breakout star of the team, everyone knew it. His singles matches showed a
burgeoning talent that was not going to be held back for long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frankly, Hart should have broken out on his own well before he did. It would have given him
more time to ply his craft in the mid-card. It could have given us some great match-ups that we were
deprived of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;too-soon-cryme-tyme&quot;&gt;Too Soon: Cryme Tyme&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cryme Tyme was together for quite some time on the main roster. They started in 2006 and
were positively received by the crowd. JTG and Shad were charismatic and played the roles given to
them perfectly. Their skits were some of the more entertaining ones and solidified their spot on the
roster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all this talent it would have been nice to see them accomplish more. They were never
given a legitimate shot at the championships and were relegated to the lowest part of the card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only after a pairing with Cena did they seem to move forward but they were broken up soon after. It would
have been great to see them given more time and a championship run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-soon-enough-harlem-heat&quot;&gt;Not Soon Enough: Harlem Heat&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harlem Heat suffered from the Hart Foundation problem but in WCW. Stevie Ray and Booker T
were great together but there was no doubt that Booker T was the breakout star of the group. He was
younger, more charismatic, and showed the in-ring skills that could vault him to the top of the card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, both men ruled the tag division. It was theirs and they had the championship
reigns to prove it. After a while, though, their act became dull. It was the same old routine and it was
wearing thin on many. It also showed that Booker T needed to branch out, but they kept going. Luckily,
when Booker did split he became a singles star but that trigger should have been pulled sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;too-soon-the-legacy&quot;&gt;Too Soon: The Legacy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Randy Orton is no stranger to stables. He has been part of some of the best in wrestling history,
but the time spent with The Legacy was a slight flop. This could have been in large part due to the stable
not getting the time that they deserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having Dibiase and Rhodes as the tag team of The Legacy was a fantastic idea. They were third-
generation stars that had the cocky demeanor necessary to run through the roster. They even
accomplished this for a short time before being disbanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If The Legacy had been kept together longer they could have established themselves as top stars
in the company. Their split and feud with Orton happened too soon and damaged both wrestlers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-soon-enough-the-new-day&quot;&gt;Not Soon Enough: The New Day&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much success as these three men have had together, they clung to their gimmick for far too
long. In the beginning, forming The New Day was a great idea. Woods and Big E had been going nowhere
and it looked like Kofi Kingston had reached his limit in WWE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The run that the trio went on was nothing short of spectacular. They held the tag titles for
longer than anyone and became a very popular part of the roster. They continued this run for longer
than anyone thought they could but this slowly became stale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After years of being together, there was nothing new for the group to accomplish. They had
done everything they could and most of their acts were nothing new. The group became stale and
required a break to freshen things up. This is a fact that remains to this day.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>dan-sinasac</name></author><category term="articles" /><summary type="html">Tag Team Break-Ups</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Pretty Ricky Willdy joins Guilmy for a chat and it about the Nov 5th Charity Show for Arthur Caulfield</title><link href="/guilmy-talks/Pretty-Ricky-Willdy-joins-Guilmy-for-a-chat-and-it-about-the-Nov-5th-Charity-Show-for-Arthur-Caulfield/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Pretty Ricky Willdy joins Guilmy for a chat and it about the Nov 5th Charity Show for Arthur Caulfield" /><published>2022-10-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-10-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/guilmy-talks/Pretty%20Ricky%20Willdy%20joins%20Guilmy%20for%20a%20chat%20and%20it%20about%20the%20Nov%205th%20Charity%20Show%20for%20Arthur%20Caulfield</id><content type="html" xml:base="/guilmy-talks/Pretty-Ricky-Willdy-joins-Guilmy-for-a-chat-and-it-about-the-Nov-5th-Charity-Show-for-Arthur-Caulfield/"></content><author><name>justin-guilmette</name></author><category term="guilmy-talks" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Kaun of Shane Taylor Promotions talks Tony Khan AEW Dark Tapings</title><link href="/jofo-in-the-ring/videos/Kaun-of-Shane-Taylor-Promotions-talks-Tony-Khan-AEW-Dark-Tapings/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Kaun of Shane Taylor Promotions talks Tony Khan AEW Dark Tapings" /><published>2022-10-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-10-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/jofo-in-the-ring/videos/Kaun%20of%20Shane%20Taylor%20Promotions%20talks%20Tony%20Khan%20AEW%20Dark%20Tapings</id><content type="html" xml:base="/jofo-in-the-ring/videos/Kaun-of-Shane-Taylor-Promotions-talks-Tony-Khan-AEW-Dark-Tapings/"></content><author><name>jofo-in-the-ring</name></author><category term="jofo-in-the-ring" /><category term="videos" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Lance Archer @ AEW DARK TORONTO</title><link href="/jofo-in-the-ring/videos/Lance-Archer-AEW-DARK-TORONTO/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Lance Archer @ AEW DARK TORONTO" /><published>2022-10-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-10-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/jofo-in-the-ring/videos/Lance%20Archer%20%20AEW%20DARK%20TORONTO</id><content type="html" xml:base="/jofo-in-the-ring/videos/Lance-Archer-AEW-DARK-TORONTO/"></content><author><name>jofo-in-the-ring</name></author><category term="jofo-in-the-ring" /><category term="videos" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Power Hour Four</title><link href="/power-hour/videos/The-Power-Hour-Four/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Power Hour Four" /><published>2022-10-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-10-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/power-hour/videos/The%20Power%20Hour%20Four</id><content type="html" xml:base="/power-hour/videos/The-Power-Hour-Four/"></content><author><name>power-hour</name></author><category term="power-hour" /><category term="videos" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Issue 41/Shows of October 8-14, 2022</title><link href="/articles/Issue-41-Shows-of-October-8-14,-2022/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Issue 41/Shows of October 8-14, 2022" /><published>2022-10-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-10-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/articles/Issue%2041%20Shows%20of%20October%208-14,%202022</id><content type="html" xml:base="/articles/Issue-41-Shows-of-October-8-14,-2022/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2022-03-23/pro darin.png&quot; alt=&quot;pro darin&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wxw-we-love-wrestling-35&quot;&gt;wXw We Love Wrestling 35&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re kicking things off with a belated recap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 35th episode of wXw We Love Wrestling took place on July 16, 2022 at the Batschkapp in Frankfurt, Germany. It was the last episode prior to Dead End which would take place later that month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six matches were on the card including two six-man tag team matches that I enjoyed. The first half of the show, consisting of three one-on-one matches, was lukewarm until the second half of the show turned everything up a notch or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2022-10-26/wxw we love wrestling 35.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;wxw we love wrestling 35&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said, I enjoyed both six-man tag team bouts that took place on this episode; the two were Amboss members Arrows of Hungary &amp;amp; Robert Dreissker taking on LSG (Leon St. Giovanni if you’re unfamiliar with the wrestler from New Jersey), Elijah Blum &amp;amp; Peter Tihanyi, and Rott und Flott &amp;amp; Tristan Archer taking on Only Friends &amp;amp; Jurn Simmons. The better of those two bouts would have to go to the second six-man tag team match of the night which was the main event (as well as my favorite match of the episode). Besides a pier six brawl that took place in and outside the ring earlier and near the end of the bout, it also showed all six wrestlers looking for a confidence boost heading into Dead End as well as the Tag Team Festival; in the end, it was the trio of Michael Knight, Bobby Gunns and Jurn Simmons that emerged victorious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the match results from Frankfurt…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-1-ahura-defeated-norman-harras-to-become-the-1-contender-for-the-wxw-unified-world-wrestling-championship-at-shortcut-to-the-top&quot;&gt;Match #1: Ahura defeated Norman Harras to become the #1 contender for the wXw Unified World Wrestling Championship at Shortcut To the Top.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahura once again came to the ring with his own wXw Shotgun Championship belt; he posed with it one minute into the match until a tug-of-war with the title occurred between the two. Then, Harras raked his opponent in the eyes before hitting him with the Hostile Takeover (gutwrench neckbreaker) for a near fall. This match then became something straight out of Progress Wrestling as Harras attempted to throw Ahura into the chairs at ringside until Ahura blocked the attempt before the Director of Sports used the referee as a shield and forearmed him. Then, when Harras argued with the referee, Ahura hit him with a springboard corkscrew crossbody into the chairs. As soon as the action returned to the ring, Ahura won with a Zigzag. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 2.5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-2-levaniel-defeated-hektor-invictus&quot;&gt;Match #2: Levaniel defeated Hektor Invictus.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the match started, Levaniel promised to stay away from Jurn Simmons in his upcoming match with Tristan Archer for the wXw Unified World Wrestling Championship, and then told Invictus to feel his wrath. After Levaniel hit Invictus with a Randy Orton backbreaker followed by a clothesline for two, he went for the Galactic Facecrusher until Invictus blocked it before making a comeback including hitting him with a moonsault. The match ended with Levaniel blocking Invictus’ attempt for a second moonsault with a knee before rolling him up for the win. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 2.5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-3-b3cca-defeated-orsi&quot;&gt;Match #3: B3CCA defeated Orsi.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was B3CCA’s wXw debut. After Orsi hit B3CCA with a spear for two, she put her in a Boston crab (ironically since the newcomer hails from Massachusetts). B3CCA, after being pulled away from the ropes, rolled out of the hold and hit Orsi with a double stomp followed by a shining wizard for the win; it looked like Orsi got her shoulder up as the three count was being made, but—according to the referee—was a nanosecond or two too late. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 2/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-4-arrows-of-hungary--robert-dreissker-defeated-lsg-elijah-blum--peter-tihanyi&quot;&gt;Match #4: Arrows of Hungary &amp;amp; Robert Dreissker defeated LSG, Elijah Blum &amp;amp; Peter Tihanyi.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless my memory of entrance theme songs are way off, it sounded like Blum is sharing the same theme song as “The Phoenix” Jody Fleisch. Also, this was LSG’s return to wXw in four years. Towards the end, Team LSG (as LSG called him and his tag team partners earlier in an interview by Ahmad Dimassi) targeted Dreissker as they climbed to the top rope until Icarus and Dover caused LSG and Blum to land groin first on the top turnbuckle while Dreissker dodged Tihanyi’s attempt for a 450. Then, the three Amboss members won after a spear by Dreissker followed by the Crossfire by Arrows of Hungary to Tihanyi. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 3.25/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-5-maggot-vs-vincent-heisenberg-ended-in-a-time-limit-draw-maggot-retained-the-wxw-shotgun-championship&quot;&gt;Match #5: Maggot vs. Vincent Heisenberg ended in a time limit draw; Maggot retained the wXw Shotgun Championship.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This match, created by Norman Harras, had Baby Allison as the special guest referee. As soon as the match began, Maggot and Heisenberg decided to stay at ringside, and as Allison counted up to seven, Harras appeared and told them not to weasel out of the match or else Maggot and Allison would be stripped of—respectively—their Shotgun and Women’s Championships. Then, Heisenberg refused to be pinned by Maggot and decided to wrestle him instead; Allison refused to do the pin count for Heisenberg before finally deciding to do so. After Maggot hit Heisenberg with a superplex, the action continued even with Maggot using Allison as a shield until she slapped the two competitors and coerced them to sit down as the clock ran out. After the three sat down—as if they were at a campfire—in the middle of the ring as ordered by Allison, the time ran out and Maggot retained the belt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, Allison had Maggot and Heisenberg shake hands, then Harras came into the ring and grabbed her by the hair while berating her until Allison slapped him; she then stood in the ring and celebrated with Maggot and Heisenberg while Harras continued to yell at her like Rick Sanchez accusing his grandson Morty Smith for screwing up. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 2.25/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;main-event-only-friends--jurn-simmons-defeated-rott-und-flott--tristan-archer&quot;&gt;Main event: Only Friends &amp;amp; Jurn Simmons defeated Rott und Flott &amp;amp; Tristan Archer.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Knight, Bobby Gunns and Simmons ambushed their opponents before the match began until Gunns and Nikita Charisma were in the ring. All six men would then brawl out of the ring a minute or so later; Simmons had two fans hold Archer for him while he was punching him, and—ending the brawl—Knight was beaten down at the entryway by Charisma, Michel Schenkenberg and Archer before he was brought back into the ring. Towards the end, all six men traded finishers in the ring, and then beat each other down again (Rott und Flott and Only Friends beating each other down, followed by Archer and Simmons clotheslining each other down) until Knight and Gunns hit Charisma with an ushigoroshi/running punt combo for two. Then, Knight put Charisma in a dragon sleeper and—while Gunns had Schenkenberg in an octopus—made him submit. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 3.75/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;extreme-rules&quot;&gt;Extreme Rules&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the belated recap is out of the way, it’s time to go to the United States and head to the Wells Fargo Center in my hometown of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania! Cue “Villain” by Bella Poarch, bring guests such as NXT wrestlers Nikkita Lyons and Bron Breakker as well as the Philadelphia Flyers’ mascot Gritty, because it’s time for Extreme Rules!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2022-10-26/extreme_rules.png&quot; alt=&quot;extreme rules&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the second time in WWE history, the pay-per-view/premium live event Extreme Rules took place in Philadelphia, the same city where the original ECW was born (hardcore wrestling and all); the first time this event took place in Philadelphia was in 2019 at the same venue. This event of course had matches were no count outs or disqualifications occurred; the matches that took place were—in order—a Good Ol’ Fashioned Donnybrook, an Extreme Rules match, a strap match, a ladder match, an “I Quit” match and the Fight Pit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I get to those six matches (which I ended up giving an above average rating by the way), there was one moment that surprised everyone in attendance (as well as those scanning QR codes that appeared on episodes of Raw and SmackDown) as the event was coming to a close. As soon as the event was getting ready to get off the air, the lights went out and a familiar male voice singing “He’s got the whole world in his hands” could be heard; life-size versions of the Firefly Funhouse characters (Huskus the Pig, Mercy the Buzzard, the Rambling Rabbit and Abby the Witch) appeared in the audience, a severed head appeared on the announce table (freaking out Michael Cole and Corey Graves), and someone dressed up as the Fiend also appeared in the audience. Then, what was left of the Firefly Funhouse—cobwebs and all—appeared on the screen as a doorway appeared at the entryway; a TV with distorted static was turned on in the funhouse, and it showed a demon-like face along with someone dressed up as a rabbit. Then, the door opened and it was Bray Wyatt—wearing the demon-like face—who returned, lantern and all. That is indeed one great way to bring back the wrestler Wyatt, even with his ever so famous crazy personas from his “Wyatt Family” days to the Firefly Funhouse and now to whatever he has up in his sleeve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onto the matches, not only did we have matches that were under extreme rules (pun intended), but there were two women’s championships—Raw and SmackDown—on the line. I liked the Raw Women’s Championship ladder match more, mainly because it showed Bianca Belair throwing the fact that she was outnumbered (courtesy of the rest of Bayley’s team Damage CTRL) out the window as well as how she and Bayley fought tooth and nail for the gold, ladders and all. The SmackDown Women’s Championship match under Extreme Rules was good too, even though there were a handful of botch spots that did or didn’t involve weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the rest of the matches that weren’t championship matches, I thought that the “I Quit” match was the best match of the event. It was a great battle between the Judgment Day founder and member—Edge and Finn Bálor respectively—that occurred in and outside of the ring as well as dark and disturbing moments courtesy of Bálor’s colleagues along with an ending similar to how Spike Trivet defeated Cara Noir in day 2 of Progress Chapter 135. My second best would go to the Good Ol’ Fashioned Donnybrook which was indeed a great battle showcasing six heavy hitters. The other two matches were good as well even though the strap match was more of a one-sided bout as well as having an odd start and finish, and I expected more in the Fight Pit after seeing the past two Fight Pits on NXT (which were pretty much better than this one in my opinion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the match results from Philadelphia…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-1-the-brawling-brutes-defeated-imperium-in-a-good-ol-fashioned-donnybrook&quot;&gt;Match #1: The Brawling Brutes defeated Imperium in a Good Ol’ Fashioned Donnybrook.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bar counters, bar stools, shillelaghs and barrels were at ringside. During the match, Butch dove into Giovanni Vinci and Ludwig Kaiser, causing a portion of the LED barricade to collapse. Both teams used shillelaghs during and near the end of this match, with Gunther striking Sheamus with two shillelagh shots for a two count; he then went for a powerbomb until Ridge Holland and Butch stopped him, leading to Sheamus hitting the “Ring General” with a shillelagh shot of his own. Then, Sheamus hit Gunther with the Celtic Cross through the announce table before the rest of the Brawling Brutes held up Vinci who was hit by Sheamus’ Brogue Kick for the win. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 4/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-2-ronda-rousey-defeated-liv-morgan-in-an-extreme-rules-match-to-become-the-new-smackdown-womens-champion&quot;&gt;Match #2: Ronda Rousey defeated Liv Morgan in an Extreme Rules match to become the new SmackDown Women’s Champion.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ronda wore a pink Gi in honor of the late Gene LeBell, and also wore ring gear that had slogans from the movie “They Cult” (which starred the late “Rowdy” Roddy Piper). Liv’s baseball bat (covered in stickers, a pink ribbon and a chain), a steel chair, a table, Ronda’s Gi and blackbelt, and a fire extinguisher were used in this bout. Towards the end, Liv put Ronda through the table with a top rope senton for two until Ronda attempted to put her in an armbar before turning it into a biceps crusher; Liv—while smirking for some reason—was incapacitated, and Ronda won. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 3/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-3-karrion-kross-w-scarlett-defeated-drew-mcintyre-in-a-strap-match&quot;&gt;Match #3: Karrion Kross (w/ Scarlett) defeated Drew McIntyre in a strap match.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the match started, Kross refused to put on the strap, and Scarlett pulled it to get McIntyre’s attention, allowing Kross to fight him out of the ring and into the crowd. As soon as both men came back in the ring, McIntyre hit Kross with a sidewalk slam on the apron before putting the strap on his opponent to start the match. Kross worked on McIntyre’s left shoulder during the match, and then—after whipping him with the strap at ringside—hit him with the Doomsday Saito for a near fall. Then, McIntyre came back with a Future Shock and went for the Claymore until Scarlett ran in and sprayed him with pepper spray, leading to Kross winning with a running forearm from behind (known as the Kross Hammer). &lt;strong&gt;My score: 3/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-4-bianca-belair-defeated-bayley-in-a-ladder-match-to-retain-the-raw-womens-championship&quot;&gt;Match #4: Bianca Belair defeated Bayley in a ladder match to retain the Raw Women’s Championship.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bayley wore an arm band reading “Sara”, paying tribute to Tough Enough winner and former WWE wrestler Sara Lee whom we lost days prior to this event. Besides large and small ladders, a broken ladder was also used as a weapon in this bout. Towards the end, Bayley attempted to use a hinge from her knee brace as a weapon until Bianca hit her with the K.O.D.; she then climbed up until Dakota Kai and Iyo Sky knocked her off and attacked her. Bianca fought back and hit Dakota and Iyo with a double K.O.D., and Bayley—with a bloody left elbow and lips—used half of the broken ladder before hitting the “EST” with the Rose Plant and then trapping her under a ladder. Bayley climbed up the ladder until Bianca lifted it while on her back, then after fighting at the top of the ladder, Bayley grabbed the broken ladder half until Bianca hit her—as well as the ladder half—with the K.O.D. before climbing up, grabbing the belt, and winning. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 3.75/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-5-finn-bálor-defeated-edge-in-an-i-quit-match&quot;&gt;Match #5: Finn Bálor defeated Edge in an “I Quit” match.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bálor wore a spiked mask, covering his face, to the ring. Edge’s left knee was worked on during the match. Both wrestlers fought out of the ring and into the crowd including the kickoff show set where Edge attacked the Judgment Day member with a hockey stick and used it to stretch his opponent’s mouth. The two then fought up a stairway where Edge sent Bálor head first into an overhang until Bálor sent him gut first into a railing. The action spilled back in the ring and Bálor attacked him with a steel chair until Edge said “I…I…don’t quit.” Edge came back until Damian Priest ran in and he fought him out of the ring. Then, Dominik Mysterio pulled Bálor out of the ring until Edge speared him off the apron and into the JD members. Then, Rhea Ripley came from the crowd and handcuffed Edge to the top rope, leading to Priest, Bálor and Dominik beating down Edge until Rey Mysterio ran and took down Priest and Bálor with a chair before Dominik attacked his father. Bálor attacked Edge with a kendo stick until all of the sudden, Beth Phoenix took the stick and attacked him and Priest with the stick, and then fought Rhea before hitting her with a spear and freeing Edge. Edge hit Priest with a spear, kicked Dominik below the belt, and—after a sling blade from Bálor—hit Bálor with three spears and used a piece of a chair to stretch his opponent’s mouth until he saw Rhea knock out Beth with brass knuckles. The Judgment Day beat down Edge, with Bálor hitting Edge with the Coup de Grace three times until Edge said “Go to hell”; then, Rhea threatened to hit Beth with the Conchairto until Edge said “I quit.” Afterwards, Rhea hit Beth with the Conchairto before the Judgment Day left. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 4.25/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;main-event-matt-riddle-defeated-seth-freakin-rollins-in-a-fight-pit&quot;&gt;Main event: Matt Riddle defeated Seth “Freakin” Rollins in a Fight Pit.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel Cormier, UFC Hall of Famer and former heavyweight champion, was the special guest referee for this match. Rollins wore ring gear that paid homage to ECW original Rob Van Dam. Cormier got physical and read both wrestlers the riot act after both Rollins and Riddle made contact with him while beating down each other. Cormier even delayed the count to ten attempt after Rollins took down Riddle for some reason. Riddle countered a Peruvian necktie attempt with the RKO until both men got up at 8, then Rollins blocked the second RKO attempt and hit Riddle with the Stomp until Riddle got up at 9. Both men climbed to the balcony where the two fought at one of the four chains that held the Fight Pit, then Rollins hit Riddle with the Pedigree on the balcony until Riddle dodged the Stomp and hit him with an RKO that caused him to fall off the balcony and back into the ring. Then, Riddle hit Rollins with the Broton from the balcony until the two got up at eight, and then Riddle made Rollins submit to a triangle choke. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 3/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;icw-fight-club&quot;&gt;ICW Fight Club&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now head to the Asylum in Glasgow, Scotland in the United Kingdom for an episode of ICW Fight Club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2022-10-26/icw_fight_club.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;icw fight club&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The buildup for Fear &amp;amp; Loathing XIV continued, especially in one of the three matches that took place. Remember when I predicted that there was going to be a fatal four-way for the ICW World Heavyweight Championship? Let’s just say I was half correct on that prediction as you’ll see shortly. The second and third matches of the episode were much better than the opening match which was short lived (even though the opening match had a surprise post-match moment per se). Chris Bungard got even better in his pro wrestling skills in the second match against the self-proclaimed “wrestling god” Theo Doros even with a result he didn’t like picking up, and the main event ended up being my favorite match of the episode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main event was Craig Anthony taking on Stevie James; the two wrestlers are part of the ICW World Heavyweight Championship hunt that also includes Leyton Buzzard. It was indeed a hard-hitting battle between Anthony and James, even with close attempts to getting a three count. If there was a rematch between the two, I would definitely hope that it would be as good as—or even better than—this week’s main event. This match by the way ended with someone receiving a DQ win that no one, not even the competitors in this match, liked one bit.
Here are the match results from Glasgow…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-1-moxie-malone-defeated-daisy-jenkins-in-four-minutes&quot;&gt;Match #1: Moxie Malone defeated Daisy Jenkins in four minutes.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was Daisy’s ICW debut. Moxie won after incapacitating Daisy with a sleeper/bodyscissors combo. After the match, Moxie attempted to attack Daisy with a steel chair until Angel Hayze ran in and stopped her. Then, ADM came into the ring and played peacemaker until Angel slapped him before he hit her with a chokeslam backbreaker. ADM then whispered in Moxie’s ear, leading to Moxie striking her several times with a chair…and becoming a new member of the Manifesto! That surprising moment definitely overshadowed that short-lived bout; I got a gut feeling that this group is becoming the next Judgment Day (even if the Manifesto still has the same captain per se). &lt;strong&gt;My score: 0.5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-2-chris-bungard-w-rudo-defeated-theo-doros-by-count-out&quot;&gt;Match #2: Chris Bungard (w/ Rudo) defeated Theo Doros by count out.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rudo joined Billy Kirkwood and James R. Kennedy on commentary. Bungard had his own rendition of “Suplex City”, hitting Doros with multiple German suplexes, until—towards the end—Doros escaped a sleeper attempt and got out of the ring before deciding to get himself counted out on purpose. After the match, Rudo called Doros a “dafty” for walking out, and then said that he hoped that Aaron Echo knows what he’s in for when facing Bungard at Fear &amp;amp; Loathing XIV. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 4/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;main-event-the-outlaw-stevie-james-defeated-craig-anthony-by-disqualification&quot;&gt;Main event: “The Outlaw” Stevie James defeated Craig Anthony by disqualification.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the match, Anthony went for a tope, but missed and crashed headfirst into a barricade, leading to James coming back and hitting him with a tope of his own. Anthony would then be whipped over another barricade until Anthony fought back including hitting “The Outlaw” with a springboard forearm from the barricade. Anthony later attempted to hit James with a German suplex off the apron until James turned it into a uranage on the apron. Near the end, James struck Anthony with a reverse brainbuster for two, followed by a trifecta of super kicks and a brainbuster for another two; Anthony came back with a superplex until James sprung up with another brainbuster for another two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, Kez Evans ran in and attacked James, giving “The Outlaw” a DQ win. Afterwards, Anthony fought Evans until Leyton Buzzard ran in and attacked “The Natural” while James and Evans went at it. Referees, security guards, and ICW wrestlers (including Daz Black and Vaughn Vertigo) ran in to stop the brouhaha before Mark Dallas appeared at the entryway; he announced that at Fear &amp;amp; Loathing XIV, Evans will defend the ICW World Heavyweight Championship against Buzzard, James and Anthony in a four-way elimination match. After the announcement was made as the dust settled, the challengers chased the champion out of the ring. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 4.5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nxt&quot;&gt;NXT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now head to Orlando, Florida in the United States for an episode of NXT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, NXT turned from a multicolored brand to a white-and-gold brand. This week, another change up was made as Vic Joseph is now accompanied by WWE Hall of Famer and former WWE and WCW champion Booker T; Wade Barrett, who was with Joseph (as well as Beth Phoenix) since August 2020, is now with Michael Cole on SmackDown. Good luck wishes go out to both Booker T and Wade Barrett on their new commentary roles on those two shows! (The same goes for Kevin Patrick and Corey Graves who are now working as a duo on Raw.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were three matches I enjoyed on this week’s episode of NXT. One was a triple threat tag team match where the winning team would become #1 contenders for the NXT Tag Team Championship against Pretty Deadly; those three teams that competed in that bout were Malik Blade &amp;amp; Edris Enofé, Josh Briggs &amp;amp; Brooks Jensen, and the Dyad. All three teams definitely gave their all in this bout, regardless of whether or not they had to keep their heads on swivels or who was at ringside. In the end, the win would belong to a rising tag team—Blade &amp;amp; Enofé—that has been on a roll as of late on both NXT and NXT: LVL UP; I have been a big fan of this duo as of late, and you can tell that they’re closing in on winning gold in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2022-10-26/nxt.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;nxt&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other match I enjoyed was the main event match between Ilja Dragunov and Grayson Waller. This indeed made a good warm up match for Dragunov, a couple weeks prior to Halloween Havoc where he’ll fight JD McDonagh and Bron Breakker for the NXT Championship; he showed the 2.0 original Waller what he’s best known for just like he has on Progress, NXT UK, ICW, wXw and other companies he competed back then. Waller showed what he can master as a competitor as well, even with his cocky character coming into play. In the end, it was Dragunov who won courtesy of a sign that he’ll face Apollo Crews at Halloween Havoc, wheel and all. (Oh, and yes, we will see that wheel get spun at that event!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite match of the episode goes to the conclusion of the best of three series between two NXT UK alumni Nathan Frazer and Axiom. This time, the stakes were higher for the two wrestlers as the winner of this bout would qualify to participate in a ladder match for the currently vacant NXT North American Championship at Halloween Havoc. Their first encounter didn’t disappoint me one bit, and neither did their second and third matches; this was indeed as good as the last best of three series I saw—Aigle Blanc vs. Senza Volto in wXw to be more specific—from high flying action that also consisted of “blind and you’ll miss it” moments to seeing how much the prize, in the form of that spot, meant to the two. In the end, it was Frazer who took the 2-1 lead and won.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the NXT results from Orlando…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-1-bron-breakker-defeated-javier-bernal-in-three-minutes&quot;&gt;Match #1: Bron Breakker defeated Javier Bernal in three minutes.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JD McDonagh joined Vic Joseph and Booker T on commentary. Breakker won after hitting Bernal with a powerslam. After the match, McDonagh came into the ring and walked up to Breakker until Ilja Dragunov came in and approached the two. McDonagh hit Dragunov with a headbutt, then fought Breakker until Dragunov hit Breakker—instead of McDonagh who ducked—with the Torpedo. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 1.5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-2-nathan-frazer-defeated-axiom-in-a-qualifier-for-the-nxt-north-american-championship-match-at-halloween-havoc&quot;&gt;Match #2: Nathan Frazer defeated Axiom in a qualifier for the NXT North American Championship match at Halloween Havoc.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the match, Frazer attempted to throw Axiom off the top rope with a hurricanrana until Axiom slid down and dragged him into the top rope, causing his opponent to land awkwardly.  Later, Frazer went for a corkscrew moonsault, but Axiom countered with a triangle choke which he then converted into a crossface until Frazer grabbed the bottom rope to break it. Towards the end, both wrestlers traded super kicks until Axiom hit him with a pump knee; Axiom then went for the Golden Ratio until the two exchanged rollups before Frazer picked up the win with the last rollup made. Both men shook hands afterwards. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 4.5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-3-indi-hartwell-defeated-valentina-feroz-w-sanga-in-three-and-a-half-minutes&quot;&gt;Match #3: Indi Hartwell defeated Valentina Feroz (w/ Sanga) in three and a half minutes.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the match, Veer Mahaan appeared and whispered in Sanga’s ear, leading to the two leaving (an Indus Sher reunion perhaps?); Valentina didn’t notice this until one minute later. Indi won after suplexing Valentina off the apron and back into the ring (ala Claudio Castagnoli). &lt;strong&gt;My score: 1.5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-4-malik-blade--edris-enofé-defeated-josh-briggs--brooks-jensen-w-fallon-henley-and-the-dyad-w-joe-gacy-in-a-triple-threat-tag-team-match-to-become-1-contenders-for-the-nxt-tag-team-championship&quot;&gt;Match #4: Malik Blade &amp;amp; Edris Enofé defeated Josh Briggs &amp;amp; Brooks Jensen (w/ Fallon Henley) and the Dyad (w/ Joe Gacy) in a triple threat tag team match to become #1 contenders for the NXT Tag Team Championship.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty Deadly—pretending to be shirtless sports fans with “GO PD” on their stomachs and backs (GO on front and PD on back to be more specific), Elton Prince wearing a foam cowboy hat, and Kit Wilson wearing a beer drinking cap—watched the match from the stage; they taunted the three teams prior to this match taking place. During the match, the Dyad attempted to hit Enofé with a superplex until Jensen turned it into the Tower of Doom, powerbombing the Dyad while they superplexed Enofé. Towards the end, Gacy hit Enofé with a clothesline until Cameron Grimes appeared and hit Gacy with the Cave In. The Dyad attempted to hit Enofé—who was put back in the ring by Gacy prior to Grimes’ appearance—with the Ticket To Mayhem until Grimes pulled Rip Fowler out of the ring, allowing Enofé to rollup Jagger Reid for the win. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 3.25/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-5-alba-fyre-defeated-jacy-jayne-w-gigi-dolin-in-three-and-a-half-minutes&quot;&gt;Match #5: Alba Fyre defeated Jacy Jayne (w/ Gigi Dolin) in three and a half minutes.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Alba hit the Toxic Attraction members with a tope, she knocked Gigi off the apron until Jacy rolled her up with a handful of tights; Alba kicked out and then won with the Fyre Bomb. Suddenly, after the match, Alba was attacked by a woman in a hoodie from the crowd, and the woman turned out to be SmackDown’s Sonya Deville. Sonya, Gigi and Jacy beat down Alba, and then hit her with a Shield powerbomb through the announce table. (I wonder if Sonya has moved from SmackDown to NXT now that she’s possibly a new member of Toxic Attraction…) &lt;strong&gt;No score.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-6-wes-lee-defeated-stacks-in-almost-four-minutes&quot;&gt;Match #6: Wes Lee defeated Stacks in almost four minutes.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee’s left knee was worked on after Stacks blocked a drop toehold into the corner. Lee came back and won with a corkscrew senton (that ended up getting the “didn’t get all of it” treatment sadly). After the match, Trick Williams and Carmelo Hayes ran in and attacked Lee until Oro Mensah ran in and evened the odds, fighting the two out of the ring before Lee dove onto them. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 0.5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-7-kiana-james-defeated-thea-hail-w-andre-chase-and-bodhi-hayward-in-a-little-over-a-minute&quot;&gt;Match #7: Kiana James defeated Thea Hail (w/ Andre Chase and Bodhi Hayward) in a little over a minute.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the match began, Mr. Stone stormed into the ring and blamed everyone for laughing at him after he was slammed onto the floor by Thea last week; he then vowed to run Thea’s night until Thea made him a laughingstock again by—this time—hitting him with a back body drop. Then, Kiana hit the distracted Thea with a spinning faceplant and pinned her for the win. &lt;strong&gt;No score.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;main-event-ilja-dragunov-defeated-grayson-waller&quot;&gt;Main event: Ilja Dragunov defeated Grayson Waller.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the match, Waller—while working on Dragunov’s neck—taunted Booker T by pretending to attempt the Spinaroonie before telling him to “suck it.” Towards the end, Waller got out of the ring to set up for a through-the-ropes cutter until he saw the Halloween Havoc wheel spinning next to him; he then went for the cutter until Dragunov countered with back-to-back German suplexes followed by a deadlift suplex and the Torpedo for the win. After the match, Bron Breakker ran in and gave Dragunov a receipt in the form of a spear; JD McDonagh appeared in the crowd and applauded and smirked while watching what happened between his two Halloween Havoc opponents. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 3.25/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nxt-lvl-up&quot;&gt;NXT: LVL UP&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staying in Orlando, we wrap things up with NXT: LVL UP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick note before the recap: You may have noticed that Sudu Shah teamed up with Byron Saxton on commentary this week; this is because Nigel McGuinness—whom we’ve heard on this show besides 205 Live, NXT UK and NXT—was released from the WWE last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the recap, I’m giving this episode a 2.5 out of 5 besides giving the matches—spoiler alert!—2.5 out of 5. This week, we saw a tag team bout followed by two one-on-one matches with the main event involving NXT’s women’s division.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tag team match, regardless of how much I missed (probably less than 30 seconds or so) because of Peacock’s broadcast delay that occurred for some reason, was indeed a good way to kick off this week’s episode; not only did it show Duke Hudson—who was one of the competitors in this match—looking to overshadow his second straight NXT loss that occurred in a match that lasted for less than a minute, but also how well he did while tagging along with Bryson Montana in their match against Ikemen Jiro and newcomer Tank Ledger. Regardless of how well he and Montana did, they still came up short courtesy of their opponents who had a good showing too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second match saw Myles Borne pick up his second career victory over Dante Chen who has been on a roll as of late on NXT: LVL UP just like the aforementioned tag team of Malik Blade &amp;amp; Edris Enofé. Chen showed that he still has what it takes to look for another win, as did Borne who was looking for his second career win which he did as I just noted. Not only do I expect more from Chen in his later matches, but also the same thing for the hearing-impaired competitor who continues to build his momentum match after match.
The main event saw Ivy Nile take on Lash Legend. Not only did it show Lash attempting to stop her ongoing losing streak, but it also saw Ivy looking to overshadow her career first NXT loss that occurred in a tag team bout not too long ago. It was size vs. strength in this main event, and in the end, Ivy made the well-known catchphrase “size doesn’t matter” come into play by defeating Lash. The two wrestlers did indeed have a good showing in this match. I wonder when Lash will end her losing streak…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting that thought aside, let’s take a look at the NXT: LVL UP results from Orlando…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-1-ikemen-jiro--tank-ledger-defeated-duke-hudson--bryson-montana&quot;&gt;Match #1: Ikemen Jiro &amp;amp; Tank Ledger defeated Duke Hudson &amp;amp; Bryson Montana.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, this was Ledger’s debut. The team of Jiro and Ledger won after Jiro hit Montana with the Ikemen Slash. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 2.5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-2-myles-borne-defeated-dante-chen&quot;&gt;Match #2: Myles Borne defeated Dante Chen.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Chen hit Borne with a big boot, Borne came back with a belly-to-belly suplex, a dropkick and an elevated flatliner for the win. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 2.5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;main-event-ivy-nile-defeated-lash-legend&quot;&gt;Main event: Ivy Nile defeated Lash Legend.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lash made Ivy’s comeback short lived after her opponent hit her with an enzuigiri and a running boot, and then she went for a reverse DDT until Ivy countered with a dragon sleeper; Lash tapped out and Ivy won. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 2.5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-time&quot;&gt;Next time…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The currently usual three, and a belated recap or two. That is all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;progress-chapter-140-wrestling-golf-madrid-in-that-order&quot;&gt;Progress Chapter 140: Wrestling, Golf, Madrid In That Order&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We kick things off with a belated recap of Progress Chapter 140: Wrestling, Golf, Madrid In That Order. Personally, if it were me, my three things would be wrestling, NASCAR, and any of the Philadelphia sports teams in that order…lol…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2022-10-26/progress wrestling golf madrid.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;progress cardiff&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 140th chapter of Progress took place at the Tramshed in Cardiff, Wales in the United Kingdom, one night after Clash At the Castle and ICW Whit’s Occurrin’?! took place in the same city. (Oh, and yes, there were Clash At the Castle references on the broadcast including Olie Spring saying “bit of a clash last night…” on commentary and Gene Munny saying that there were “clashes at castles” after his match with LJ Cleary.) Just like in the last chapter, this chapter saw all four of Progress championships—five if you count the Gene Munny World Championship—on the line. Besides championship matches, we saw Mike Bird return to Progress—since 2018—in his home Wales, Malik showing his future opponent Anthony Ogogo what he’s capable of, Laura di Matteo looking to make a comeback trail after a trio of matches with Kanji for the Progress Women’s Championship, a future shot at the Progress Tag Team Championship on the line, and Spike Trivet working on two of his reigns which are his Progress World Championship reign and his reign of terror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of the regular matches that didn’t see gold—Progress’ or Gene Munny’s—on the line, my favorite would have to go to the match between Danny Black and Mike Bird. Not only did this show Black continuing to rise when it comes to singles competition besides tag team competition (even with the rest of CPF), but also what Bird had in store in his return to Progress. It was a good back and forth match that occurred early in this chapter, and in the end, it was Wales’ own Bird who emerged victorious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of the five matches with gold on the line, my favorite championship match also became my favorite match of this chapter; it involved the Progress Atlas Championship defended by Luke Jacobs against—returning to Progress action—Rickie Shane Page. This match looked like something that would have taken place in another tournament involving the Atlas Championship, with Jacobs being aware that size and strength came into play and Page giving him a good run for his money (or in that case, championship gold). In the end, it was the North West Strong member Jacobs who retained the belt over Page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the match results from Cardiff…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-1-gene-munny-defeated-lj-cleary-to-retain-the-gene-munny-world-championship&quot;&gt;Match #1: Gene Munny defeated LJ Cleary to retain the Gene Munny World Championship.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been meaning to mention Munny’s new theme song, but I definitely miss his previous theme song that had 80’s vibes (even though his new theme song also has saxophone solos per se). Before the match started, Munny and Cleary argued over whether or not the championship belt on the line was real, and then—seconds before the bell rang—Cleary dropkicked him out of the ring. After Cleary countered the Ainsley Lariat with a jumping knee, Munny grabbed a tiny rendition of the Gene Munny title from the front of his tights until Cleary kicked it out of his hands. The match ended with Munny hitting Cleary with a pumphandle faceplant followed by the Ainsley Lariat for the win. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 2/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-2-mike-bird-defeated-danny-black-w-maverick-mayhew&quot;&gt;Match #2: Mike Bird defeated Danny Black (w/ Maverick Mayhew).&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Bird hit Black with a diving knee drop for two (which saw Black barely get his shoulder up), he countered a top rope hurricanrana with a middle rope powerbomb before hitting him with a Gotch piledriver and then putting him in a dragon clutch; Black tapped out and Bird won. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 3.5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-3-malik-w-kosta-konstantino-defeated-maverick-mayhew-w-danny-black&quot;&gt;Match #3: Malik (w/ Kosta Konstantino) defeated Maverick Mayhew (w/ Danny Black).&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in the match, Mayhew hit Malik with a tope con giro into the chairs at ringside before hitting him with a Swanton bomb for two. Malik came back and hit Mayhew with the Chut-knee (Bryan Danielson knee) and faked a pin attempt before winning with Anthony Ogogo’s pop up punch. After the match, Konstantino called Mayhew a “cheap Callum Newman”, and Malik mocked the fans by saying “baa” to them before Konstantino praised him for beating the “Olympic piss” out of Ogogo in the last chapter; Konstantino then said that Ogogo will find out why Malik is “the hitta”, and then berated Olie Spring and SoCal Val on the way out. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 2/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-4-laura-di-matteo-defeated-rhio&quot;&gt;Match #4: Laura di Matteo defeated Rhio.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both wrestlers fought out of the ring in the beginning after Rhio hit Laura with a shotgun dropkick. Laura put Rhio in the Veni Vidi Vici until Rhio put her foot on the bottom rope and made a comeback; the comeback was short lived as Laura made her submit to another Veni Vidi Vici. Post-match, Rhio blamed herself for not having the matches go as planned; she then vowed to bring a “different Rhio” next time. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 2.5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-5-the-sunshine-machine-defeated-dan-moloney--man-like-dereiss-and-the-smokin-aces-in-a-tornado-tag-match-to-retain-the-progress-tag-team-championship&quot;&gt;Match #5: The Sunshine Machine defeated Dan Moloney &amp;amp; Man Like Dereiss and the Smokin’ Aces in a tornado tag match to retain the Progress Tag Team Championship.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lykos Gym joined Olie Spring and SoCal Val on commentary. After the 0121 members Moloney and Dereiss took down Nick Riley, Dereiss hit Riley with the Four Fiddy until each pin attempt was broken by a Chuck Mambo frog splash, a Charlie Sterling headbutt, and a TK Cooper shooting star press (with all three hitting Riley as Dereiss dodged them) before Sterling pulled the referee out of the ring. Near the end, Mambo hit Moloney, Dereiss and the Smokin’ Aces with an assisted 450 at ringside before the Sunshine Machine put Sterling back in the ring and won with the Designated Driver. Post-match, Lykos Gym attempted to go after the Sunshine Machine until the champions shooed them away. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 3.5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-6-luke-jacobs-defeated-rickey-shane-page-to-retain-the-progress-atlas-championship&quot;&gt;Match #6: Luke Jacobs defeated Rickey Shane Page to retain the Progress Atlas Championship.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Jacobs surprised Page with a spinebuster, Page booted him until Jacobs hit him with the Burning Lariat for a near fall. Then, both wrestlers exchanged chops until Page hit Jacobs with a Saito suplex, a cutter and a frog splash for two. Towards the end, Jacobs put him in a sleeper until Page got out of it with a Saito suplex; Jacobs came back with a second Burning Lariat, and then put him in a grounded sleeper to make him tap out. Page applauded at Jacobs afterwards. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 4.25/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-7-the-greedy-souls-defeated-lykos-gym-to-become-1-contenders-for-the-progress-tag-team-championship&quot;&gt;Match #7: The Greedy Souls defeated Lykos Gym to become #1 contenders for the Progress Tag Team Championship.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kid Lykos &amp;amp; Kid Lykos II blindsided Brendan White &amp;amp; Danny Jones before the match began. During the match, Lykos Gym went for a double brainbuster until White—who hit the two with several bodyslams prior to that attempt—countered with a double suplex. Near the end, White went for a black hole slam until Kid Lykos II countered with an octopus which was then broken up by Jones; behind the referee’s back, Kid Lykos II took out a baking tray until the Sunshine Machine stopped and punched him. This led to Jones catapulting Kid Lykos II into White’s black hole slam for the win. Post-match, the Greedy Souls promised to return to Cardiff as the Progress Tag Team Champions. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 2/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-8-kanji-defeated-alexxis-falcon-jody-threat-and-skye-smitson-w-lana-austin-in-a-fatal-four-way-match-to-retain-the-progress-womens-championship&quot;&gt;Match #8: Kanji defeated Alexxis Falcon, Jody Threat and Skye Smitson (w/ Lana Austin) in a fatal four-way match to retain the Progress Women’s Championship.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was Jody’s Progress debut. During the match, Kanji put Jody in a triangle choke while Skye put Alexxis in a sleeper hold; both Kanji and Skye traded shots while clinging onto their opponents until Jody rolled up Kanji for two while Alexxis got out of the sleeper with a backpack stunner before a Falcon’s Fury led to Jody breaking up the pin. Towards the end, Lana stopped Kanji from fighting Skye until Kanji struck her with a back elbow. Then, Jody hit Skye with an F5 and then hit Kanji with a Michinoku driver for two until Kanji made her submit to a triangle choke. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 3/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;main-event-spike-trivet-defeated-eddie-dennis-to-retain-the-progress-world-championship&quot;&gt;Main event: Spike Trivet defeated Eddie Dennis to retain the Progress World Championship.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trivet—with a new theme song instead of “Concerto No. 2 in G minor, Op. 8, RV 315, ‘Summer’” (or as I like to call it the Steven Bochco Productions theme)—wiped his nose on the Wales flag as he was coming into the ring. There was a shoving match between the two wrestlers, seconds before the bell rang, until Dennis hit him with a knockout punch for two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A minute or so later, Dennis hit Trivet with a tope con giro, and then fans held him for Dennis to attack him; one fan almost got hit by Dennis, leading to Trivet getting the upper hand. The two then fought to the entryway, and Trivet went for a package piledriver on the stage until Dennis countered with a back body drop; Dennis then hit Trivet with the Severed Bridge off the stage and into the ring crew at ringside. Trivet made a comeback and worked on Dennis’ left leg, and then went for a middle rope Codebreaker until Dennis countered with the Gunslinger for a near fall; Trivet was able to hit Dennis with the middle rope Codebreaker, followed by a DDT from the apron to the floor, and then a top rope DDT for two. Dennis hit Trivet with the Severed Bridge for a near fall, then Trivet put him in the Blackout sleeper (ala Cara Noir) until Dennis got out of it with a necktie backcracker. Dennis then hit Trivet with the Neck Snap Driver for the win before the referee pointed out that Trivet’s foot was on the bottom rope; as the match was restarting, Trivet blindsided Dennis with a bottle, and the referee attempted to disqualify Trivet until Dennis talked him out of it. This led to Trivet hitting Dennis with two package piledrivers for back-to-back near falls before incapacitating him with the Ascot. Post-match, Trivet claimed that he had a special place for the fans in his heart, and—ala Joe Gacy—promised to make Progress a “safer place.” &lt;strong&gt;My score: 3/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wxw-dead-end-2022&quot;&gt;wXw Dead End 2022&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onto the second belated recap, it’s time to take a look back at wXw Dead End 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dead End 2022 took place at the Gruenspan in Hamburg, Germany on July 23, 2022. Ever since I started to pay more attention to wXw early last year, this was the second Dead End event for me; the first one I saw took place in an empty venue where the main event was Bobby Gunns defending the wXw Unified World Wrestling Championship, long championship reign and all, against Marius Al-Ani who was building his winning streak…and I can still remember hearing Dave Bradshaw screaming on commentary (“Diamond Driver! Al-Ani! Al-Ani!”) as soon as Al-Ani won the belt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to this year, on the card for Dead End 2022 were four championship matches, a regular one-on-one match that kicked off the show with a bang, and a regular tag team match that went awry at the end. There were also heartbreaking moments just like the Charlotte roval Cup Series race (where Chase Elliott had the race won until he got spun out prior to overtime, and Kyle Larson—the defending NASCAR Cup Series champion—getting eliminated in the playoffs); there were—as the saying goes even according to ABC’s Wide World of Sports—agonies of defeat in the forms of getting kicked out of a then-upcoming event as well as fight for one of wXw’s belts one last time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2022-10-26/dead_end_2022.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;wxw dead end 2022&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sandwiching four matches that ranged from fair to good in my point of view were a great opener and closer. Starting off with the closer, it was Tristan Archer defending the wXw Unified World Wrestling Championship against—once more—Jurn Simmons who was attempting to become the company’s first ever four-time champion; as promised, Levaniel—who didn’t have a match for this year’s Dead End—allowed Simmons to fight Archer for the title without any interference. It was a very good back and forth bout, even with Archer having tricks up his sleeve as usual—ever since turning heel as soon as this year was beginning—and Simmons’ power coming into play. In the end, it was Archer who retained the belt after interference cost Simmons the win…and it wasn’t from Levaniel; it was from one of his past opponents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the opener, it was my favorite match of Dead End. The opener was LSG taking on Axel Tischer; Cara Noir was scheduled to be Tischer’s opponent, but he was absent due to an ankle injury. (Remember when that ankle injury was referenced in Progress a few chapters ago?) Even though part of me was bummed out that we wouldn’t see a rematch between the “Axeman” and the “Black Swan” at this year’s Dead End (and whether or not if it would be as good as or even better than their encounter at Broken Rules), I didn’t mind watching Tischer clash with Leon St. Giovanni. This replacement match was better than I expected, seeing a strong showing from LSG besides Tischer; in the end, it was Tischer who was the winner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the match results from Hamburg…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-1-axel-tischer-defeated-lsg&quot;&gt;Match #1: Axel Tischer defeated LSG.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LSG went for a springboard elbow, but Tischer countered it with an uppercut; Tischer then went for the Liger Bomb until LSG rolled him up for two before Tischer picked up the win with an elevated sit out uranage. Both men shook hands and raised arms afterwards. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 4/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-2-baby-allison-defeated-b3cca-to-retain-the-wxw-womens-championship&quot;&gt;Match #2: Baby Allison defeated B3CCA to retain the wXw Women’s Championship.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allison surprised B3CCA during the match by crawling upside down ala Bray Wyatt (and, no, you didn’t need a QR code to see that occur…lol…). B3CCA fought back until Allison hit her with a superplex and made her submit to a cravat. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 2.5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-3-rott-und-flott-defeated-only-friends-to-retain-the-wxw-world-tag-team-championship&quot;&gt;Match #3: Rott und Flott defeated Only Friends to retain the wXw World Tag Team Championship;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only Friends are barred from the wXw Tag Team Festival. Michel Schenkenberg and Nikita Charisma blindsided Bobby Gunns and Michael Knight seconds before the bell rang until Only Friends fought back. After Rott und Flott hit Knight with the Snapchat (or as MNM called it “Snapshot”) and Gunns broke up the pin; Knight put Charisma in a dragon sleeper while Gunns put Schenkenberg in an octopus; Charisma tapped out and Only Friends won…before they, along with the referee who was new to wXw, learned that Charisma wasn’t the legal competitor. The match restarted and, near the end, Rott und Flott hit Gunns with the Snapchat for a near fall; Schenkenberg attempted to bring in one of the tag team belts until Knight stopped him before—behind the referee’s back—Charisma hit Gunns with a low blow before rolling him up and pinning him for the win. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 2.5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-4-laurance-roman--robert-dreissker-vs-aigle-blanc--senza-volto-ended-in-a-double-count-out&quot;&gt;Match #4: Laurance Roman &amp;amp; Robert Dreissker vs. Aigle Blanc &amp;amp; Senza Volto ended in a double count out.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Amboss members fought Aigle Blanc at ringside, Aigle Blanc went for a top rope moonsault until Dreissker caught him before Senza Volto hit him and Roman with a tope suicida. The four wrestlers continued to brawl at ringside until both teams were counted out. Afterwards, both teams fought back in the ring, and the Amboss members had the upper hand until LSG and Elijah Blum—equipped with a steel chair—ran in; Roman and Dreissker fought back, and then wrapped Blum’s head around the chair until LSG, Aigle Blanc and Senza Volto fought the Amboss members out of the ring while rescuing him. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 3/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-5-maggot-w-baby-allison-defeated-apu-singh-to-retain-the-wxw-shotgun-championship&quot;&gt;Match #5: Maggot (w/ Baby Allison) defeated Apu Singh to retain the wXw Shotgun Championship.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was Singh’s debut. After Maggot hit Singh with a spear for a near fall, he went for a cutter until Singh blocked it and hit him with a scoop powerslam for two; Singh then caught Maggot who went for a crossbody until Maggot freed himself and won with a cutter. After the match, Allison and Maggot reminded Norman Harras that they’re still champions, and were thankful for a free trip to Hamburg. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 2/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;main-event-tristan-archer-defeated-jurn-simmons-to-retain-the-wxw-unified-world-wrestling-championship&quot;&gt;Main event: Tristan Archer defeated Jurn Simmons to retain the wXw Unified World Wrestling Championship.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Simmons lost, he will never fight for the title again as long as Archer is still the champion. There was a highlight video of Simmons’ career, including his championship reigns, before he came to the ring. During the match, Simmons blocked the Coup d’État and hit Archer with a clothesline, then climbed to the top rope until Archer shoved the referee into the ropes, causing the challenger to get crotched on the top turnbuckle. Then, after Archer hit Simmons with a superplex for two, both men—while closing in on the end of the match—nearly hit the referee until Archer’s discus clothesline took him down; while the referee was unconscious, Simmons hit Archer with a Claymore and spear until all of the sudden, Vincent Heisenberg came and attacked Simmons. Archer pinned Simmons for two, then Simmons countered the Coup d’État with a powerslam until Heisenberg distracted him; Simmons knocked the “beast of the north” off the apron until Archer blindsided the challenger with a discus clothesline before winning with the Coup d’État. After the match, Heisenberg attacked Simmons until Levaniel ran in and he and Simmons fought him out of the ring. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 3.75/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;icw-fight-club&quot;&gt;ICW Fight Club&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the belated recaps are out of the way, it’s time to head to the Asylum in Glasgow, Scotland in the United Kingdom for ICW Fight Club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the buildup to Fear &amp;amp; Loathing XIV continuing, there were four matches that took place this week. I enjoyed both the opening and closing matches that took place; the opener was now-former Manifesto member Dylan Thorn taking on Eddie Castle, and the closer was Kez Evans taking on Saqib Ali in a non-title match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the opener, we saw Thorn finally flying solo without any backup ever since getting kicked out of the Manifesto at Shug’s Hoose Party 7. It looks like we might see him take on ADM at F&amp;amp;L as he’s starting things off by going toe-to-toe with other members of the Manifesto with—as we saw this week—Eddie Castle being his first opponent post-Manifesto. Both wrestlers had a strong showing in this opener even before ADM, Grant McIvor and new addition Moxie Malone appeared at ringside. In the end, it was Castle who was the winner after the numbers game—in the form of the rest of the Manifesto—closed in on his opponent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2022-10-26/icw new.png&quot; alt=&quot;icw fight club&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closer became my favorite match of the episode, and as I noted, it was between Kez Evans and Saqib Ali. Evans is indeed correct in his interview by Cal Wolfe (I still don’t know if I spelled the interviewer’s name right, and if I didn’t, then I apologize for that) that Ali is a funny and entertaining competitor; Ali proved that he’s more than just what Evans noted, showing that he can clash with top names—including those that hold gold such as the ICW World Heavyweight Championship belt—especially in main event matches such as this one. In the end, Evans defeated Ali even saving a dirty tactic such as brass knuckles post-match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the match results from Glasgow…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-1-eddie-castle-defeated-dylan-thorn&quot;&gt;Match #1: Eddie Castle defeated Dylan Thorn.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADM and Moxie Malone appeared at the entryway early in the match, ditto Grant McIvor while Castle and Thorn fought at ringside. Near the end, Castle blocked the Crown of Thorns and then—after telling Moxie, who got on the apron, to stay down—hit Thorn with the Snakebite (or “Kross Hammer” as Karrion Kross calls it as we learned at Extreme Rules) for a near fall. Thorn fought back until ADM got his attention, leading to Castle winning with the Venom Injection (Sister Abigail sans the kiss). Post-match, Thorn said “Well done” to the rest of the Manifesto for helping Castle win, and then said that ADM—who came into the ring—dropped his “crown of thorns”, leading to Thorn hitting him with the Crown of Thorns before getting the hell out of dodge as Castle, McIvor and Moxie ran in. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 4/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-2-denise-w-jackie-polo-defeated-daisy-jenkins&quot;&gt;Match #2: Denise (w/ “Jackie Polo”) defeated Daisy Jenkins.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was Denise’s first match; she threw her jacket at Daisy before fighting her. After Daisy missed with a corkscrew Vader bomb, Denise hit her with a neckbreaker followed by a Death Valley bomb for the win. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 1/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-3-jason-reed-w-coach-trip-defeated-jimmy-pierce-w-the-wee-man&quot;&gt;Match #3: Jason Reed (w/ Coach Trip) defeated Jimmy Pierce (w/ The Wee Man).&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the match started, the Wee Man said that Pierce was tested against Reed who had “a body of an athlete and a face of a Cabbage Patch doll”, and then called Reed an “Oompa Loompa” and Trip “Willy Wonka”; Reed silenced the Wee Man by kneeing Pierce in the stomach seconds before the bell rang. Near the end, Trip distracted Pierce until the Wee Man hit the coach with a low blow, leading to Pierce turning back to Reed and rolling him up for two until Reed won with the Club Deck. After the match, Reed attacked Pierce until the Wee Man stopped him; Trip threw the Wee Man out of the ring, and then punched Pierce who was then hit by Reed’s second Club Deck. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 2/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;main-event-kez-evans-defeated-saqib-ali-w-chris-toal-in-a-non-title-match&quot;&gt;Main event: Kez Evans defeated Saqib Ali (w/ Chris Toal) in a non-title match.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the match, Evans countered Ali’s Saq Magik with a clothesline, and then hit him with the Garvin stomp until he was distracted by Toal and his megaphone; Evans went after Toal until Ali hit him with a baseball slide before whipping him into the barricade. The end of the match saw Evans counter the Saq Magik for the second time but with the Blood Clot Clutch; Ali tapped out and Evans won. After the match, Evans teased Toal by attempting to hit him with brass knuckles, but instead hit Ali with them and left. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 4.5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nxt&quot;&gt;NXT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we head to Orlando, Florida in the United States for an episode of NXT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only was it the go-home episode of NXT prior to Halloween Havoc, but it also had wrestlers from Raw and SmackDown—especially those that competed in NXT back when it was the black-and-gold brand—either visiting or in action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the wrestlers from outside NXT that was visiting was former NXT Champion Kevin Owens who was hosting a special episode of the KO Show. (The last time Owens hosted the KO Show on NXT was in late 2020, one month after part of the WWE Performance Center became the Capitol Wrestling Center.) His guests were three wrestlers competing for the NXT Championship at Halloween Havoc, whom were the champion Bron Breakker, JD McDonagh and Ilja Dragunov. McDonagh claimed to be on his best behavior unlike Breakker and Dragunov last week, and Dragunov said that the Torpedo was meant for the “Irish Ace” but hitting Breakker with it was “no mistake” and thus it made the champion “beatable.” Owens then noticed that McDonagh was stirring the pot by having his Halloween Havoc opponent tear each other apart prior to the event, even before McDonagh noted that he wanted them to be put in “physical pain and mental anguish”; this led to Dragunov saying that McDonagh will always “be the contender” and never the champion, and Breakker saying that Dragunov should be in the same category until Dragunov noted the last time Breakker lost in a triple threat match where the NXT Championship belt was on the line. Then, Breakker and Dragunov went at it with security guards trying to separate the two and McDonagh smirking in a corner; Dragunov hit Breakker with the Torpedo, then hit McDonagh with a headbutt and Torpedo. It didn’t end there however as Austin Theory, Money In the Bank briefcase and all, appeared at the entryway as the episode of NXT was coming to a close. I was pretty sure that Theory was still eyeing on the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship that’s currently held by Roman Reigns, but I got a gut feeling that he’ll cash in the briefcase at Halloween Havoc either after or—like what Seth Rollins did at WrestleMania years ago—during the match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/2022-10-26/nxt_rhea.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;nxt&quot; class=&quot;restrict-width&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were seven matches that took place this week on NXT, and one of the “pick your poison” matches—suggested by Grayson Waller in his episode of “The Grayson Waller Effect” with Cora Jade and Roxanne Perez as his guests—became my favorite match of the night. The two matches that were suggested by Waller involved Cora and Roxanne looking for opponents of their choosing on the main roster; Roxanne went to SmackDown and selected Raquel Rodriguez as Cora’s opponent, and Cora went to Raw and selected Rhea Ripley as Roxanne’s opponent.
I honestly wanted to see more of the second “pick your poison” match between Cora and Raquel, but it ended up being short lived probably to make room—and more time—for the KO Show segment that would wrap up this week’s episode of NXT; I could be wrong though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the first “pick your poison” match of the episode, this match highlighted Roxanne Perez having a strong showing when fighting top competitors including those that are no longer on NXT as well as dealing with the numbers game, especially in the form of the rest of the Judgment Day that was also in attendance on this episode. Even though Rhea was the winner in this bout, if Roxanne can keep doing what she’s doing when it comes to competing, we can definitely see her close in on winning more gold especially on the NXT brand.
Here are the NXT results from Orlando…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-1-rhea-ripley-w-finn-bálor-dominik-mysterio-and-damian-priest-defeated-roxanne-perez&quot;&gt;Match #1: Rhea Ripley (w/ Finn Bálor, Dominik Mysterio and Damian Priest) defeated Roxanne Perez.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Roxanne blocked the Riptide attempt and Rhea did the same to the Pop Rox attempt, Mysterio distracted Roxanne, leading to Rhea winning with the Riptide. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 4.25/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-2-shinsuke-nakamura-vs-stacks-w-tony-dangelo&quot;&gt;Match #2: Shinsuke Nakamura vs. Stacks (w/ Tony D’Angelo).&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This match was made by D’Angelo who accused Stacks of not following orders; he said that this match was about respect and proving everybody who Stacks is. After Nakamura hit Stacks with a Kinshasa that sent him out of the ring, he put his opponent back inside and won with a second Kinshasa. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 2/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-3-alba-fyre-defeated-sonya-deville-w-gigi-dolin-and-jacy-jayne-in-two-minutes&quot;&gt;Match #3: Alba Fyre defeated Sonya Deville (w/ Gigi Dolin and Jacy Jayne) in two minutes.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gigi and Jacy interfered until Alba fought them away; Sonya attempted to boot Alba, but missed and hit Jacy, allowing Alba to win with a rollup. After the match, Sonya, Gigi and Jacy attacked Alba, then Mandy Rose appeared and vowed to “fight fire with fire” at Halloween Havoc; Alba fought back with her baseball bat—that Sonya and the Toxic Attraction members were using during the post-match ambush—before chasing Mandy out of the ring with the bat. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 0.5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-4-carmelo-hayes--trick-williams-defeated-wes-lee--oro-mensah-in-almost-three-minutes&quot;&gt;Match #4: Carmelo Hayes &amp;amp; Trick Williams defeated Wes Lee &amp;amp; Oro Mensah in almost three minutes.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hayes and Williams attacked Lee and Mensah in the locker room and to the ring before the match. The two then won after Hayes hit Lee with Nothing But Net. After the match, Hayes and Williams beat down Lee and Mensah some more until the two fought back. Then, Hayes dove onto Lee and Mensah, Von Wagner appeared and booted Hayes, and Nathan Frazer came from the crowd and dove onto Wagner from the top rope. &lt;strong&gt;No score.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-5-cameron-grimes-karl-anderson--luke-gallows-defeated-the-schism&quot;&gt;Match #5: Cameron Grimes, Karl Anderson &amp;amp; Luke Gallows defeated the Schism.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you that lived under a rock, Anderson and Gallows returned to the WWE one week prior to this episode of NXT; they reunited with AJ Styles on Raw, bringing back the OC. Also, this match was made by the Schism who challenged Grimes to a match after he interfered in last week’s match that had a shot at the NXT Tag Team Championship on the line; Grimes, despite not having a lot of friends on the NXT roster, decided to go to Raw and have Anderson and Gallows as his tag team partners. During the match, all six men fought at ringside until Grimes, Anderson and Gallows knocked the heads of Joe Gacy, Rip Fowler and Jagger Reid; as the action returned to the ring, the Dyad swung Grimes like a cradled child into Gacy who hit him with a powerbomb. Near the end, after Reid stopped Anderson and Gallows from hitting Fowler with the Magic Killer, the Dyad attempted to hit Anderson with the Ticket To Mayhem until Grimes took down Fowler with the Cave In; this led to Anderson and Gallows hitting Reid with the Magic Killer for the win. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 2.75/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-6-quincy-elliott-defeated-xyon-quinn-in-almost-three-minutes&quot;&gt;Match #6: Quincy Elliott defeated Xyon Quinn in almost three minutes.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This match was made after Quinn told SmackDown’s Shotzi that he wanted to host Halloween Havoc until Elliott confronted him; Shotzi then made this match where the winner would be the co-host of Halloween Havoc. Shotzi would then join Vic Joseph and Booker T on commentary afterwards. Towards the end, Quinn lifted Elliott until Elliott fell on top of him before missing on a splash attempt; Quinn attempted to grab something on ringside until he noticed Hank Walker in attendance, leading to Elliott hitting Quinn—who ran back in empty handed—with a splash to the back followed by the Bonsai Drop (now known as the Diva Drop) for the win. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 0.5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;main-event-cora-jade-defeated-raquel-gonzalez-by-disqualification-in-almost-three-minutes&quot;&gt;Main event: Cora Jade defeated Raquel Gonzalez by disqualification in almost three minutes.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cora attempted to hit Raquel with her kendo stick until Raquel took it and hit Cora with it, giving Cora the DQ win. After the match, Roxanne Perez fought Cora back into the ring, and then hit her with the kendo stick. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 0.5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nxt-lvl-up&quot;&gt;NXT: LVL UP&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staying in Orlando, we wrap things up with an episode of NXT: LVL UP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of the three matches that took place were fairly better than the second match in my point of view. The first match saw Myles Borne taking on Ikemen Jiro; Borne showed what he could do when picking up more wins including overcoming obstacles such as an issue with one of his four limbs during the bout, and Jiro continued to have a strong showing especially in singles competition besides—like what we saw in last week’s episode—tag team competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closing match was between Andre Chase and Javier Bernal. The self-proclaimed “Big Body Javi” does indeed make a good cocky heel when it comes to getting under his opponent’s skin, while the heart and soul of Chase U continues to impress the audience with competition besides having his Chase U gimmick get a cult following like a TV series or movie that ends up getting a fanbase. In the end, it was Chase who scored the win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the NXT: LVL UP results from Orlando…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-1-myles-borne-defeated-ikemen-jiro&quot;&gt;Match #1: Myles Borne defeated Ikemen Jiro.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borne tweaked his left knee during the match, leading to Jiro working on it. The end of the match saw Jiro hit Borne with a Jacket Punch, and then go for the Ikemen Slash until Borne countered it with a rollup for the win. Both men shook hands afterwards. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 2/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;match-2-duke-hudson-defeated-bryson-montana-in-almost-four-minutes&quot;&gt;Match #2: Duke Hudson defeated Bryson Montana in almost four minutes.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This match was made after their loss in a tag team match against Ikemen Jiro and Tank Ledger on last week’s episode. Hudson won after hitting Montana with a running big boot. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 1/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;main-event-andre-chase-w-thea-hail-defeated-javier-bernal&quot;&gt;Main event: Andre Chase (w/ Thea Hail) defeated Javier Bernal.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernal was preoccupied with the Chase U section in the audience, leading to Chase fighting back, hitting him with the Chase U stomp and winning with a top rope crossbody. &lt;strong&gt;My score: 2/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-time&quot;&gt;Next time…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only do I have my currently usual three shows, but I will also look back at NXT Halloween Havoc. Plus, I might throw in a belated recap or two (like I have been saying week after week). Not to worry, I have been catching up on Progress and wXw events that have appeared on Peacock!&lt;/p&gt;
