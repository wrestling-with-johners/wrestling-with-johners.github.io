Rating 4.5 out of 5 *</p>

<p>Killer Kross and Scarlott Bordeaux come to the ring and start beating down the Besties</p>

<p>This show was thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish obviously the AEW guys were saying goodbye to the company so it made sense for the other guys to go over</p>

<p>REPORT FOR NIGHT 2 COMING SOON…</p>
